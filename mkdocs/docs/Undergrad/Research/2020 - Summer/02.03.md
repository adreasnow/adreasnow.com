## To do

* [ ] Read deeper into SAPT
* [x] Re-submit the ion pair jobs
* [ ] Figure out how to run the Pd PES jobs
* [ ] look in to ssNMR


## What I did

I checked the jobs that ran over the weekend:

* All the SAPT jobs failed
* The Ion Pairs: 
  * Timed out
  * Linear angles
  * Link 9999 error

* Both the PES jobs failed

I pulled the output geometry of the failed opt jobs and put them into new input files and resubmitted them to the cluster :crossed_fingers:

For the Pd PES jobs, I restarted them with more SOSCF iterations (10) and increased the threshold from `5.0e-3` to `5.0e-5`
