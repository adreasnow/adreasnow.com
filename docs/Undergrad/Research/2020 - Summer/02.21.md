## To do

* [ ] SAPT
* [x] HF TEMPO anion
* [ ] Optimise TEMPO end-on geometries
  * [ ] SAPT
  * [ ] HF TEMPO anion

## What I did

#### 11:31 AM

I realised this morning that if we really want to check induction, we need to optimise the geometry in an end-on configuration, which I’ve set up and is ready to optimise. In the meantime, I’ve submitted the tempo HF and SAPT jobs and am making sure that they go through.

#### 3:45 PM

I kept going with the tempo SP jobs. All the HF jobs are done and the SAPT jobs are running now. They had some issues with being run as a sub shell (`$PSI4SCRATCH` wasn’t being passed through) but now that I’ve explicitly set that in the script, it’s looking much better.
