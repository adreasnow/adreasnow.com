# Week n+17

## Monday-Tuesday 25-26/10

### What I did today:

* I've put my thesis aside while all the feedback starts to pile in and and have mostly been working on trying to slam out my PhD proposal. The feedback that I have been getting has mostly been positive, though some of the non-comp feedback has been a bit disheartening to receive.
  * AAAANDDD submitted.
* I plonked in a park and started to work through some of the feedback this arvo

## Wednesday-Friday 27-29/10

### What I did today:

* So I got my feedback from Katya and there is a lot of red, so I guess my post-draft submission break is over now.
  * I've put the feedback from everyone else aside while I focus on this, since it's going to be me changing most of my stuff in the first place. 

#### Writing Tasks

* [x] Review the few red points left in the thesis (it's just the intro atm)
* [x] Finish off the rest of the drafty first edit, including all of the front/tail matter
* [ ] Implement feedback suggestions
  * [x] Sophie

* [ ] Review the paper by Wang et al. to find any other analysis that you should perform, or any other things that should be discussed.
* [ ] Proof read, proof read, proof read.
