I'm Adrea, a computational chemistry PhD candidate at Monash University. The purpose of this site is mainly to act as a repository of my notes and ramblings, it's  an incoherent collection of random markdown files, cobbled together with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) that I wanted to be easily accessible and searchable.

If you find value in it, that's always useful, but this is primarily a tool for myself and I don't expect it to be anything to anyone else, apart from collaborators or people that I want to share specifics with.

 Some of the things I'll be keeping in here are:

* Research notebooks
* Cheat sheets for specific applications, tools, processes or techniques
* Notes based on different resources that I’ve pursued.
* Some notes from undergrad (please don’t judge me too harshly for those...)
