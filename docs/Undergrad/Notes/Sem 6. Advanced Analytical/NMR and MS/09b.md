# Checklists

## MS Checklist

* Look for $M^+$ (though you might not find it)
* Look for isotope pattersn
  * e.g. Br (1:1), Cl (3:1)
* Look for obvious fragments
  * Heavy elements
  * Aromatic rings - Ph at 77, Toluene at 91
  * Hydrocarbon fragments - $\ce{xCH3}$ at $x15$ 
* If they're big peaks try and identify them
* Is $M^+$ odd or even (nitrogen rule)
* [Degree of unsaturation](../../../../../equations/#double-bond-equivalents-dbe-degree-of-unstauration-dou)

## FTIR Checklist

* Look for functionality in the molecule
  * Look for specific bond types - $\ce{OH}$, $\ce{NH}$, $\ce{CH}$, $\ce{C=O}$, $\ce{C#C}$ etc.
  * What type of $\ce{C=O}$ is it (use tables)
  * Don't dwell too much

## $\cnmr$ Checklist

* Is it coupled or decoupled
* What solvent is it in, can you see the solvent peak?
* How many $\ce{^13C}$ environments are there?
* Are there any characteristic shifts - e.g. $\ce{C=O}\:\alpha$ carbon

## $\hnmr$ Checklist

* What solvent is it in, can you see the solvent peak?
  * How many peaks are there?
  * What are the splitting patterns?
  * What are the peak areas?
  * Where are the peaks? Is there obvious functionality?
