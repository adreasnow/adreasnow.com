# Aromatic - Pyridine

!!! note "Pyridine is:"
	
	1. Unreactive to EAS
	2. Reactive to NAS
	3. Electron deficient
	4. Has Lewis basic/nucleophilic LPE

## The LPE

At its most basic level, the LPE are Lewis basic and can be used catalytically, such as with bromination

!!! note "Mechanism"
	
	In this exmaple, the bromine is undergoning EAS with benzene, hwich requires catalysis

### PTB

This is actually quite  common usage and is sold as pyridinium tribromide, which is a solid, stable crystalline substance, which makes it easier to handle and weigh out

### PCC

This is also used in the oxidising agent pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC)

### Acylation

It can also be used as a better leaving group than chlorine for acylation (or more generally, esterification), as it's more active that it's acyl chloride counterpart.

### DMAP

This is further exploited by adding a dimethyl group ortho to the pyrolidinium, as the nitrogen can donate its LPE to make the new acyl group more weakly bonded.

### Alkylation

More generally, the pyridine can be alkylated by any bromoalkyl compound

## Pyridinium Ion

Once in its ionic form, the ring becomes so electron deficient that normal alkene chemistry can be performed, such as reducing, oxidising ans hydrogenating it

![!pyrolidiniumchem](pyrolidiniumchem.png){: style="width: 50%;" class="center sharp"}

It  also becomes active to simple organometallic addition and can easily be oxidised back to pyridines

## Pyridine-*N*-oxides

Are a really clever way of activating pyridines, as it will activate them to EAS (since they can't undergo EAS normally). This re-introduces Friedel-Crafts acylation, nitration and other useful EAS reactions.

### Activation

Because the oxygen can donate an electron or the nitrogen can accept one, the n-oxides are active to both EAS and NAS

![!easornas](easornas.png){: style="width: 60%;" class="center sharp"}

So they can undergo reactions like nitrations, ==with the oxygen directing *o*/*p*==, facilitated by the donation of the LPE

~~Once the desired EAS reaction has occurred, the oxide can be removed cleanly~~

![!removingo](removingo.png){: style="width: 40%;" class="center sharp"}

!!! warning
	While this  *will* remove the oxygen, however it will also add in a halide, *meta* to the nitrogen, as shown below

Another useful reaction of the *N*-oxides is that they can add a chloride ortho to the nitrogen. This conveniently also consumes the oxide in the process

!!! note "Important Chemistry"
	The synthesis of the analgesic niflumic acid is another synthesis that uses the *N*-oxide to facilitate a chlorination that allows for NAS to be directed cleanly.
