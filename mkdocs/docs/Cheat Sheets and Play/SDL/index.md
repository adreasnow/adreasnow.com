# SDL Guide

These are just my own personal ramblings and notes based on watching Chris Cramer's youtube playlist, [Computational Chemistry](https://www.youtube.com/playlist\?list\=PLkNVwyLvX_TFBLHCvApmvafqqQUHb6JwF), Niel G. Dickson's playlist [You can solve the Schrödinger equation](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnKki3hXC4NfFmNlU6XSGJaF6X9BeLRD7), Chemistry (Chang)'s kinetics chapter,  Katya Pas' CHM3911 Lectures (2017) and of course, notes from the [Virtual Winter School on Computational Chemistry](https://winterschool.cc)

!!! note
	When I started watching these videos, it was a year and a half ago and I was writing full notes for each lecture. Fast forward to early 2021 and I don't feel like I need to understand every little detail of every lecture as deeply anymore, and I feel that I've built up a decent library of fundamental knowledge. While I'm still watching and enjoying these lectures, I'm probably going to write down only the bits that I feel like I need to have on file

## Statistical Molecular Thermodynamics [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkNVwyLvX_THU2_546uTLwxnCOhQmnkbf) and [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkNVwyLvX_TGX40SR8dppBa3U66lano-s)

As much as this unit is very fundamental, I feel as though it will probably be a good idea to revise thermochemistry, and probably learn/consolidate a whole stack of stuff that Swinburne has neglected.
