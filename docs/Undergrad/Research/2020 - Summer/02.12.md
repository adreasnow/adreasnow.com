## What I did

#### 6:33 AM

I pushed on and got some of the straggling ion pairs up to the SAPT job stage. Benzene-Ni is running on Rosalind, very slowly, but making progress nonetheless. 

!!! Note
	Don't work when you're not awake yet... or too tired to focus :disappointed: <br/>
	...You will accidentally delete a whole stack of stuff




#### 5:20 PM

I did some more work on the Jupyter notebook, cleaning up the merge of the two. I also added in some new plots for more comparative visualisations.

I pushed more jobs through as well.
