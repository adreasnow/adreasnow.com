# Experimental Notes

## Solubility

* R800 and DAPI are unsurprisingly insoluble in low polarity solvents

## Collection

* BSC is extremely difficult to get completely particulate free, and this results in some erroneous scatter in the TCSPC runs.

## Intepretation

* DAA lifetimes [were documented in 1974](https://doi.org/10.1021/ja00844a033) and reported lifetimes of 17ns, but when interpreting the data, there are two decays, one contributing ~98% at a stable 6.7ns and the other contributing ~2% between 28ns and 32ns.
  * This is also proving really fit in general.
* AZ S2 TCSPC requires sub 350nm excitation wavelength which we don't have.
* R800 and NR excitation spectra go beyond the 600nm correction limit for the excitation lamp.
