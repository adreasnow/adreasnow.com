## How to conduct research

### Decide what to research

1. Identify your research topic
2. Research the Literature
3. Write a lit review
4. Formulate a question

### Plan the Research

1. Develop and refine the research design
2. Decide the type of data and how to collect it
3. Plan a data collection strategy

### Conduct the research

1. Collect the data
2. Process, analyse and visualise the data
3. Interpret the data
4. Write and publish the data
5. Write a research proposal



A research topic is a general **broad** field of interests. A research question is a **specific** component within the research topic

A research question should focus on a small subset of the overall research field.

## Basic vs applied research

Basic research stands to ask fundamental questions about the nature of things, where as applied research takes that basic research and uses it to answer technological questions.

| Type of knowledge produced |     Scientific discovery (science)      | Technological Applications (technology) |
| Motivation                 |         Intellectual curiosity          |       Solving real world problems       |
| Key Questions              | Why does it happen? Is it true that...? |  Does it work? Can we use this to...?   |
| Objective                  |              To understand              |        To come up with solutions        |

Applied research is more likely to get research from governments and industry, since they're more likely to present immediate economic value, however basic research is vital to be able to develop applied research.
