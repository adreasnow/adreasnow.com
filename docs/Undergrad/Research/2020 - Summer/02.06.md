* [ ] Figure out how to converge benzene-Ni SAPT



* [x] Check ethyne-high-above
* [x] Check furan-high-above
* [x] Process ethyne-high-above

## What I did

#### 11:59 AM

I spent an hour or so getting my enrolment stuff done for CHM3911, since my application got approved this morning. thankfully I get to keep my staff email address :smiley:

I tweaked some geometries and submitted some more ion pair opt jobs and I extracted the geometries from any completed optimisations. I pushed on to submit the SAPT jobs for all the completed ion pair jobs and will do the same for the HF jobs



#### 6:06 PM

I wrote some more jupyter code to start processing the HOMO-LUMO data from the ion pairs.

I got a haircut?...
