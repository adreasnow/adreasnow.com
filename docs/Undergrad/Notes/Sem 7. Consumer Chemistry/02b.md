# Surfactants as Emulsifiers

As per the previous notes, these are only the components of the lectures that has not already been covered in [Surface and Colloids](../../Sem%206.%20Surface%20and%20Colloids/Emulsions/08a).

## General Requirements for an Emulsifier

* Reduce the interfacial tension between the oil and the water
* Adsorb quickly at the oil-water interface
* Resist thinning when droplets collide
* Should be slightly more soluble in the continuous phase
* Aid stability to flocculation
* Aid stability to coagulation
* Increase bulk viscosity (helps to stabilise the emulsion if the droplets can't move as quickly)
*  Perform well at low concentration
* Be inexpensive
* Be Generally Recognised as Safe (GRAS)
* Be chemically compatible with the oil
* Emulsify!

## HLB

The formulation for HLB is simple:

You start with 7 and you add the HLB of the specific constituent groups within the molecule. The values come from this table:

| Hydrophobic Group       | HLB Value | Hydrophilic Group             | HLB Value |
| ----------------------- | :-------: | ----------------------------- | :-------: |
| $\ce{-CH=}$             |  -0.475   | $\ce{-SO4Na}$                 |   +38.7   |
| $\ce{-CH2-}$            |  -0.475   | $\ce{-COOK}$                  |   +21.1   |
| $\ce{H3C-}$             |  -0.475   | $\ce{-COONa}$                 |   +19.1   |
|                         |           | $\ce{NR4+}$                   |   +9.4    |
| Derived Group           | HLB Value | $\ce{-COOR-}$ (sorbitan ring) |   +6.8    |
| $\ce{-(CH2-CH2-O)-}$    |   +0.33   | $\ce{-COOR-}$ (free)          |   +2.4    |
| $\ce{-(CH2-CH(CH3)O)-}$ |   -0.15   | $\ce{-COOH}$                  |   +2.1    |
|                         |           | $\ce{-OH}$ (free)             |   +1.9    |
|                         |           | $\ce{-O-}$                    |   +1.3    |
|                         |           | $\ce{-OH}$ (sorbitan ring)    |   +0.5    |

!!! info "Example 1"
	
	Calculate the HLB for $\ce{CH3(CH2)12COOH}$ at low and high pH
	(asusme sodium salt)
	Low:
	
	$$
	\begin{align}
	HLB&=7+15(-0.475)+2.1\\
	&=1.975
	\end{align}
	$$
	
	High:
	
	$$
	\begin{align}
	HLB&=7+15(-0.475)+19.1\\
	&=18.975
	\end{align}
	$$

The function of a surfactant will vary based on its HLB value:

| HLB   | Function                    | Appearance                              |
| ----- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1-3   |                             | not dispersible                         |
| 3-6   | w/o emulsifiers             | poor dispersion                         |
| 6-8   | wetting agents              | milky dispersion after vigorous shaking |
| 8-10  | o/w emulsifiers             | stable milky dispersion                 |
| 10-13 | o/w emulsifiers             | translucent to clear dispersion         |
| \>13  | detergents and solubilisers | clear solution                          |

### HLB of Oils

The only new thing here is that if the o/w and w/o HLB of an oil are too close together, they can be particularly difficult to form either emulsion, as it will constantly try to invert.

A combination of surfactants or oils has a linear combination of their HLB values.

!!! info "Example 2"
	
	Three oils with required HLB values of 4, 9 and 12 are mixed in a 1:1:2 ratio. Calculate the required HLB of this oil mixture.
	
	$$
	\begin{align}
	HLB&=\frac{1(4)+1(9)+2(12)}{4}\\
	&=9.25
	\end{align}
	$$

To find the ratio that would give the desired HLB, we can use the equation from [Surface and Colloids](../../Sem%206.%20Surface%20and%20Colloids/Emulsions/08b/#hlb-of-surfactant-blends).

$$
\phi=\frac{HLB_f-HLB_2}{HLB_1-HLB_2}
$$


!!! info "Example 3"
	
	If an emulsion containing an oil with an HLB requirement of 12.2 is prepared using myristic acid, at what pH will it have optimal stability?
	Myristic acid = CH3(CH2)12COOH, pKa = 4.90, NaCl Electrolyte
	
	Low pH:
	
	$$
	\begin{align}
	HLB&=7+15(-0.475)+2.1\\
	&=1.975
	\end{align}
	$$
	
	High pH:
	
	$$
	\begin{align}
	HLB&=7+15(-0.475)+19.1\\
	&=18.975
	\end{align}
	$$
	
	Ratio:
	
	$$
	\begin{align}
	\phi&=\frac{HLB_f-HLB_2}{HLB_1-HLB_2}\\
	&=\frac{12.2-18.975}{1.975-18.975}
	&=0.3985
	\end{align}
	$$
	
	39% protonated/61% deprotonated
	$$
	\begin{align}
	pH&=pK_a+log\frac{[S-]}{[\ce{SH}]}\\
	&=4.90+log\frac{[0.61]}{[0.39]}\\
	&=5.35
	\end{align}
	$$
