I've been working at Xero 5 months now and am absolutley loving working in tech again, so I decided to make my social presence more reflective of this fact. This website is made in [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/), it's hosted on [Github](https://github.com/adreasnow/adreasnow.com/tree/gh-pages), and is deployed using [Github Actions](https://github.com/adreasnow/adreasnow.com/blob/main/.github/workflows/adreasnow.com.yaml).

If you'd like to access my old site, it'll still be up under [adreasnow.com/acadmeic](https://adreasnow.com/academic), so that I can keep `adreasnow.com` for my techy stuff instead :slightly_smiling_face:
