To Do:

* [ ] Read up on SAPT
  * [ ] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou0dltm4zl4
* [x] Figure out how to extract useful NBO data from calcs
* [x] Check output from ethene molclus calcs
* [x] Check SAPT output from Ethyne-NTF2
* [x] Check HF NBO calcs
* [x] Check NTF2 molclus calcs
  * [x]  Then get ethene HF calcs on 
  * [x]  Check ethene energy calcs
* [ ] ~~Try optimising palladium with ligands ($\ce{Pd(II)Cl4^{2-}}$)~~ since the ligands themselves would play a role in the interaction, this just isn't viable.
* [ ] ~~Perhaps ruthenium might be another option ($\ce{Ru(III)Cl3}$)~~ peter doesn't like to fragment periodic systems

## What I Did

I didn't have the most productive day, It was mostly spent chatting and waiting. I got the rest of the molclus jobs running, so there's currently a massive queue on monarch ATM. 

I also started the ethyne SAPT jobs, using a smaller aug-cc-pVDZ basis set (aug-cc-pVTZ-DK/aug-cc-pVTZ for Pd and Ni respectively). These are also running without CCD and with a frozen core to try and decrease job time.

 The PD ethyne/ethene jobs have been put on hold for the time being. Will discuss this further with Katya.



## In the evening

I actually had a pretty decent night and wrote up a jupyter notebook script to process the homo-lumo data and autogenerate some plots for it as well.

It makes me feel a little bit more competent that my coding skills are vaguely transferable and that I even remember some python syntax stuff.
