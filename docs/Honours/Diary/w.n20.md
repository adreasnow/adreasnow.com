# Final Week

## Monday 29/11

I haven't really posted anything here in a while since the last couple of weeks have just been implementing feedback and getting ready for my thesis defence tomorrow.

I submitted my thesis a couple of days early and haven't really looked at it since, though I'll probably have a re-read of it today so that it's a bit more fresh in my mind, ready for tomorrow. I need to practice my intro talk as well.
