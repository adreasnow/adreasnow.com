## What I did

#### 5:16 PM

The SAPT jobs timed out, so I kicked them off again, I gave them 48 hours and 32 cores, so they haven’t picked up yet.

I spent most of my day getting plots in Jupyter to look good, though I nutted out a presentation plan for Tuesday and got started on that. It look pretty good to be honest.

I guess now it’s really just time to pull it all together and try and try and figure out what to say/conclude.
