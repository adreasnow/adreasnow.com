# Energy Materials

* To measure energy, we only really care about $\Delta H$, since only exothermic energies matter
  * While $\Delta G$ will tell us about sponteneity, endothermic reactions which would give us $−\Delta H$ would pe positive $\Delta G$
* A Watt is a unit of power, $W=\frac{E}{T}=\frac{j}{s}$

## Energy Consumption

* The vast majority of our energy consumption is from fossil fuels:
  * 33% coal
    * Amorphous carbon
  * 25% natural gas
    * Primarily methane and ethane
  * 36% oil
    * Fractionally distilled into grades of fuel
* Renewable sources are as follows
  * 2% Hydroelectricity
  * 3% biomass
  * 1% wind and solar

* The end of oil isn't the end of oil, since we can liquefy coal
  
  * $\ce{C_{(s)} + H2_{(g)} -> C_x H_{y(l)}}$
* We can also produce natural gas from coal in a similar process
  * $\ce{C_{(s)} + O2_{(g)} + H2O_{(l)} -> H2_{(g)} + 3CO_{(g)} + CH4_{(g)}}$
  * This can be tweaked with more water to produce more H_2
    * $\ce{CO_{(g)} + H2O_{(l)} -> CO2_{(g)} + H2_{(g)}}$   

## Future Consumption

* We currently need 14 TW
  * 16 TW by 2050
* If we were to fully use the resources of the planet, this is how much energy we'd produce:
  * 4.6 TW (1.6 TW feasible) - Hydroelectric
  * 8 TW - nuclear (one new plant every 1.5 days forever)
  * 2 TW - tidal
  * 12 TW - geothermal (highly dependent on loacation)
  * 5-7 TW - biomass (if all cultivatable land, not used for food, were used to grow fuel)
  * 2-4 TW - wind
* Solar would produce 120000 TW over the globe
  * 800 TW feasibly
  * Is currently only 0.1% of the energy market

## Energy Density

* Is a measure of energy per unit mass
  * 0.512 $MJ\cdot kg^{-1}$  (300 bar, 12°C) - Compressed air
  * 0.001 $MJ\cdot kg^{-1}$  (100m dam height) - Pumped Water
  * Batteries:
    * 0.54-0.72 $MJ\cdot kg^{-1}$  - Li ion
    * 0.14-0.22 $MJ\cdot kg^{-1}$  - NiCd
    * 0.14-0.17 $MJ\cdot kg^{-1}$  - Pb/$\ce{H+}$
  * Capacitors:
    * 0.0206 $MJ\cdot kg^{-1}$  - Ultracapacitor
    * 0.01 $MJ\cdot kg^{-1}$  - Supercapacitor
  * Chemical bonds: (not currently efficient extraction)
    * 143 $MJ\cdot kg^{-1}$  - $\ce{H2}$  (700 bar)
    * 44 $MJ\cdot kg^{-1}$  - liquid fuels

## Solar Energy Capture

"Fundamentally, a solar cell turns light into current"

* Currently available - [pn junction type](../08.%20Photovoltaics/#p-n-junction)
  * Amorphous silica (a-Si)
  * Cadmium Telluride (CdTe)
  * Organic photovoltaic cells (OPCs)
  * Copper Indium Gallium Selenide (CIS/CIGS)
* Future types?
  * Photosynthetic - solar to chemical fuels
    * Leaf mimicking - dye sensitised solar cells
    * Biological photosynthesis

## Solar Fuels

* A fuel produced by solar means
* Typically through artificial photosynthesis or some other thermochemical reaction
* The holy grail of energy conversion is to reduce $\ce{CO2}$  to organic compounds
* Could be used as an alternative to fossil fuels
* $\ce{H2, CH4, CH3CH2OH}$
		

### Water splitting

* The general term for the reduction of water to 
* Easiest way is to electrolyse water in hydrogen and oxygen
* In photosynthesis, water splitting donates electrons into the electron transport chain
* Hydrogen is a commodity chemical, so this is a valuable process
