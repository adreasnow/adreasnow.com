# NMR Spectra
* NMR within computational can be calculated by three primary methods:
  * GAIO - Gauge-independent atomic orbital
  * IGAIM - Individual gauges for atoms in molecules
  * CSGT - Continuous set of gauge transformation
* The accuracy of each method can be system dependent
* All NMR shifts are calculated, regardless of isotopic nature
* Requires a reference compound for 0
  * Typically TMS, NH3 or H2O
* Very sensitive to functional choice
  * B3LYP doesn't perform particularly well
