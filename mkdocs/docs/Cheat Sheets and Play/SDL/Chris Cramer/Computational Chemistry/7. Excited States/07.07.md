Since excitations are adiabatic processes, the solvatochromic effect is not considered to be based on $\Delta G_{sol}^0$ and $\Delta G_{sol}^*$, as seen in the figure below. The 'Stokes shift' is the difference between the the adiabatic absorbed and emitted photons.

	The rest of this video was just on how we can use empirical parameters of polarisability and h-Bbonding acidity to create implicit solvent models to account for solvatochromism.
