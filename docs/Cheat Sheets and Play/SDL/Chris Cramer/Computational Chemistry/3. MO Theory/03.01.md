# LCAO Wave Functions

## Key Foundations of MO Theory

### Eigenfunctions and Eigenvalues

!!! Definitions
	* An **operator** is a set of instructions that acts on an adjacent function.<br/>
	* For a given operator, n function is called an **eigenfunction** if the operator returns the original function times a constant.<br/>
	* An **eigenvalue** is the constant which is returned when a given operator acts on an eigenfunction:<br/>
	* e.g. (operator)(eigenfunction)=(eigenvalue)(eigenfunction)
	

	$$
	\hat{H}\Psi=E\Psi
	$$


### Variational Principle

The variational principle states that for any guess of the wavefunction $\Phi$, the calculated value of the hamiltonian operator $H$, will never result in lower energy than the exact ground state energy of the system

* $\Phi=$ the MO wavefunction
* $E_0=$ the exact ground state energy of the system

$$
\frac{\int\Phi^*H\Phi dr}{\int\Phi^8\Phi dr}\geq E_0
$$

The best perfect wavefunction will be the one which is equal to $E_0$

### Molecular Orbitals from LCAOs

The one-electron molecular orbital $\phi$ is the liinear combination of the atomic orbitals (basis functions) $\varphi$, weighted by some coefficient $a$

$$
\phi=\sum\limits_{i=1}^N{a_i\varphi_i}
$$

* $\Phi$ is the many-electron wave function, formed of the slater determinants of the occupied $\phi$.
* To pick the basis set we start with atomic basis functions $\varphi$ (s, p, d, f functions) since we know that they are going to be centred on the atoms and we sum them together.
* We use the variational principle to iteratively optimise these steps


!!! Definition
	**Hartree Product** is the sum of one-electron molecular orbitals
	
	$$
	\sum\limits_{i=1}^N{\phi_i}
	$$

### Minimising the basis set

#### Calculating the energy

For a one-electron orbital $\Phi$ we evaluate the equation:

$$
E=\frac{\int\bigg(\sum\limits_i{a_i^*\varphi_i^*}\bigg)H\bigg(\sum\limits_j{a_j\varphi_j}\bigg)d\bf{r}}{\int\bigg(\sum\limits_i{a_i^*\varphi_i^*}\bigg)\bigg(\sum\limits_j{a_j\varphi_j}\bigg)d\bf{r}}=\frac{\sum\limits_{ij}a_i^*a_j\int\varphi_i^* H\varphi_jd\bf{r}}{\sum\limits_{ij}a_i^*a_j\int\varphi_i^* \varphi_jd\bf{r}}
$$

$i$ runs over basis functions

$j$ runs over MOs

Where we sum the basis functions and coefficients and their [complex conjugates](../.././1.%20Neil%20Dickson/#3complex-conjugate-phase-rotation-and-energy) and calculate the expectation value for the hamiltonian (top) and divide it by the integral over all space of the product.

* The integral $\int\varphi_i^* H\varphi_jd\bf{r}$ is denoted as $H_{ij}$ and is called  the  "resonance integral"
* The integral $\int\varphi_i^*\varphi_jd\bf{r}$ is denoted as $S_{ij}$ and is called the "overlap integral"

#### Minimisaiton condition

To minimise the energy we are trying to obtain:

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial a_k}=0\hspace{2cm} \text{for all }k
$$

That is that all the partial derivatives of all the $a$'s must equal zero - They're all at a stationary point

If we take all the partial derivative of the energy calculation, we get $N$ linear equations with the form

Where we are now treating $a_i$ as the variable and $(H_{ki}-ES_{ki})$ as the coefficient term. If we break that down further, we can evaluate $H_{ki}$ and $S_{ki}$, but we need to determine the energy that results in the equation $=0$.

$$
\sum\limits_{i=1}^N{a_i(H_{ki}-ES_{ki})}=0\hspace{2cm} \text{for all }k
$$

#### The Secular Determinant

Since we need to evaluate all of the coefficients as one, we can use the secular equation as:

$$
\begin{vmatrix}
H_{11}-ES_{11} & H_{12}-ES_{12} & \cdots & H_{1N}-ES_{1N} \\ 
H_{21}-ES_{21} & H_{22}-ES_{22} & \cdots & H_{2N}-ES_{2N} \\
\vdots         & \vdots         & \ddots & \vdots\\
H_{N1}-ES_{N1} & H_{N2}-ES_{N2} & \cdots & H_{NN}-ES_{NN}
\end{vmatrix}=0
$$

Fundamental algebra tells us however that this determinant is going to be a polynomial of order $N$ ($E^N$) but also that there will be $N$ possible values of $E$ that will give us a satisfactory answer (some of these may be  degenerate or complex...)



## The steps to calculate the MO:

1. Select a set of $N$ basis functions
2. Determine all ($N(N-1)/2$) values of both $H_{ij}$ and $S_{ij}$
   * While the determinant grows at a rate $N^2$, because of the symmetry of the matrix, there are fewer solutions.
3. From all the values of $H_{ij}$ and $S_{ij}$, form the secular determinant and determine the values of $E_{j}$ that satisfy the secular equation.
4. For each $E_j$, solve the set of linear equations $\bigg({a_i(H_{ki}-ES_{ki})}\bigg)$ to determine the basis set coefficients $a_{ij}$ for that MO
