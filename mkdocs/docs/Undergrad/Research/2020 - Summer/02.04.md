## To do

* [ ] Read deeper into SAPT
* [ ] Figure out how to run the Pd PES jobs
* [ ] Check on the opt jobs

## What I did

I mostly spent the day trying to compile Psi4, which i realise is a big waste of time...

Group meeting was cancelled, though I now know that Katya does indeed want me to present my research at group meeting in two weeks :confused:

I’ve decided that for the ion pairs, one of the High MO and Low MO combinations is above, it doesn't matter if it’s above or between

I wrote an extension to the slurm scripts that runs a task with a certain amount of time to go, so as to allow deleting of the scratch if the job times out.
