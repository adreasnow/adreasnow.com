# Coding Stats

These are my coding stats for the past 30 days and the past year as tracked by [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com), ~~however I run JupyterLab as a proton app, so tracking it with WakaTime is quite difficult.~~ and now that VSCode has `.ipynb` support, my Jupyter work is ALSO included :smile: 

The "Comp Chem" language here is a custom category that I made that encompasses all non-python based computational chemistry input and output files (ORCA, Q-Chem, Gaussian, Psi4, GAMESS, PackMOL, etc.), as well as Slurm and PBS job files.
