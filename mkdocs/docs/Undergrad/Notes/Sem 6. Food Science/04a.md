# Food Composition Analysis

![!](https://www.abc.net.au/cm/lb/8740924/data/nutritional-label-data.jpg){: style="width: 30%; "class="right"}

Food composition is legally presented to us in the form of a nutritional information panel (NIP). All NIP are required to show the amount of each nutrient in a **quantity of 100g** and in a **quantity of 1 serving** (determined by the manufacturer). A serving is not the same as a portion (how much you choose to consume)

The NIP may also present the recommended daily intake (%RDI), which is based on a single set of references from the "average" adult. RDIs are not particularly useful for macronutrients, but are particularly important for micronutrients (vitamins and minerals).

## Glycemic Index (GI)

Glycemic index is a measure of the effect of the carbohydrates in a particular food on the blood glucose over a period of time (formally - 2 hours after consumption). They must be tested in an analytical lab and meet strict nutritional criteria

The value itself ranges form 0 to 100, with the following definitions:

* Low - $\leq 55$
* Medium - $56-69$
* High - $\geq70$

### Criteria to be Low GI

|    GI    |                      Fat ($\:g/100\:g$)                      |   Carbohydrates   |        Sodium        |   Dietary Fibre   |
| :------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :---------------: | :------------------: | :---------------: |
| $\leq55$ | $\leq10$ (If saturated fat $\leq3.3\:g/100\:g$)<br /> $\leq15$ (if source is grains, seeds or nuts) | $\leq45\:g/serve$ | $\leq400\:mg/100\:g$ | $\geq3\:g/100\:g$ |

## Health Star Rating (HSR)

The HSR Is a front of packaging nutritional label (brief overview), that's based on the nutritional composition. It takes into account the following nutrients:

The following 8 categories of <span style="color:red">risky</span> and <span style="color:green">healthy</span>  nutrient groups must be analytically determined per $100\:g/100\:mL$:

1. Energy
2. <span style="color:red">Saturated fat </span> 
3. <span style="color:red">Total sugars</span> 
4. <span style="color:red">Sodium </span> 
5. <span style="color:green">Protein</span> 
6. <span style="color:green">Dietary fibre </span> 
7. <span style="color:green">Fruit, vegetables, nuts and legumes</span> 
8. <span style="color:green">Calcium content (dairy products)</span> 

The actual calculation is carried out using the HSR calculator (HSRC).

## Allergens

FSANZ requires foods containing allergens to be declared on the packet. These include trace amounts, such as if the factory manufactures other foods containing the allergens. These allergens include:

Peanuts, tree nuts, milk, eggs, sesame seeds, fish, shellfish, soy, lupin and wheat

## Food Composition

Nutrients are broken down into two primary categories:

* Macronutrients - required in the body on the scale of grams and make up the bulk of food
  * Protein, carbohydrates, dietary fire, fats/lipids, water
* Micronutrients - required on the $mg$ or $\mu g$ scale and only occur in trace amounts
  * Minerals, trace elements, vitamins (both water and fat soluble)
