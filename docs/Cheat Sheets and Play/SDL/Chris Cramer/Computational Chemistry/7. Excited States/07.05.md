This was very complex, so here are some takeaways:

* TD-DFT is generally better for excitations than CI due to the direct inclusion of correlations, but is naturally very functional/situation dependent.
* Charge transfer transitions are not well modelled using TD-DFT. This is due to self-interaction issues, causing lower energy excitations.
* TD-DFT works best with a bit of HF exchange (typically ~25%) - e.g. B3LYP, PBE0
* Certain functionals are better for [Rydberg states](../../../../../../PhD/Notebook/0002/#tuesday-5th-april), when they account for longer range behaviour.ÃŸ
