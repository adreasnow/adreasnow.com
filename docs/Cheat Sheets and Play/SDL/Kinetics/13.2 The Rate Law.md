# The Rate Law

The rate law takes the general form:

$$
\text{rate}=k[A]^x[B]^y
$$

$x$ and $y$ are not the molar coefficients, but are an experimental exponent that  specify the relationship between the concentrations of the reactants ($A$ and $B$) and the reaction rate. When added together, they give the ***reaction order***[^1]

!!! note
	It can be useful to measure the rate of the reaction at the beginning, as the changes will be more detectable as the concentrations change drastically.
	

	This also reduces the influence of  a back reaction ($\ce{reactants <- products}$), which would introduce an error into the rate measurement.

## Rate Law Determination

!!! note "E.g. 1 - Nitrous oxide and hydrogen gas"
	If we consider the reaction $\ce{2NO_{(g)} + 2H2_{(g)} -> N2_{(g)} + 2H2O_{(g)}}$ we can start building our rate equation.
	

	We start by putting in our reactants:
	
	$$
	\text{rate}=k[\ce{NO}]^x[\ce{H2}]^y
	$$
	
	<center markdown=True>
	
	| Experiment | $[\ce{NO}]\:(M)$ | $[\ce{H2}]\:(M)$ | Initial Rate $(M/s)$ |
	| ---------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
	| 1          | 0.0050           | 0.0020           | $1.25\times10^{-5}$  |
	| 2          | 0.0100           | 0.0020           | $5.00\times10^{-5}$  |
	| 3          | 0.0100           | 0.0040           | $1.00\times10^{-4}$  |
	
	</center>
	
	And then we can calculate the exponents for the reaction. If we look at the table above, we can see that as we increase $[\ce{NO}]$ two times[^2], the rate increases four times, so they are linked 1:2, and our exponent is 2. As we increase $[\ce{H2}]$ by two we see  an increase of 2 and therefore $x=2$ and $y=1$.
		
	$$
	\begin{align}\text{rate}&=k[\ce{NO}]^2[\ce{H2}]^1\\&=k[\ce{NO}]^2[\ce{H2}]\end{align}
	$$
	
	We can consider this to be a second order reaction in $\ce{NO}$ and first in $\ce{H2}$, but is a third order reaction overall

## Rate Constant Determination

!!! note "Example 1 - Nitrous oxide and hydrogen gas"
	We can determine this by substituting the experimental values into out rate law:
	
	$$
	\begin{align}\text{rate}&=k[\ce{NO}]^2[\ce{H2}]\\
	1.25\times10^{-5}\:M/s&=k(0.0050\:M)^2(0.0020\:M)\\
	1.25\times10^{-5}\:M/s&=k(5\times10^{-8}\:M^3)\\
	\frac{1.25\times10^{-5}\:\bcancel{M}/s}{5\times10^{-8}\:M^\bcancel{3}}&=k\\
	250\:\frac{1}{M^2\cdot s}&=k
	\end{align}
	$$
	
	It's worth noting that the units of the rate constant are not going to be the same for every reaction.

## A few Final notes

1. Rate laws are always determined experimentally. This is done by calculating the initial reaction rate with varying starting conditions.
2. Reaction order is always defined by the reactant and not the product.
3. The order of the reaction is not related to the stoichiometric coefficient.
