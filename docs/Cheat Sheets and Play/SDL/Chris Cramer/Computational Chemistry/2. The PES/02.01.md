## Main idea:

* Each structure (geometry) has an associated unique energy - PES $= f(R)$
* The changes between geometry are smooth, and so too is the PES
* Can be very highly dimensional

## Dimensionality/Degrees of freedom

* Formally the system is $3n$ dimensional ($n=$atoms) 
* Chemically speaking, the dimensionality is about relative dimensions so we use the formula $3n-6$ where $n>2$ (nonlinear molecules), just as in IR spectroscopy

Any PES that we can visualise is just a 2/3/4 dimensional "slice" of the whole multidimensional PES. This is useful for showing specific features of the landscape.
