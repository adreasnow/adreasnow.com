# Absorption and emission

Valence Electrons can make transitions between the orbitals by absorbing and emitting a discreet amount of energy

* The amount of energy absorbed and emitted must be exactly the energy difference between the two orbitals
* The energy absorbed places the atom in an excited state
* The exact amount of energy absorbed must then be radiated, as per the energy difference of orbitals

## Emission Series ![!2.1](4.1.png){: style="width: 40%;" class="right"}

* Since the emissions of light are of exactly the same energy as the energy difference between the electron orbitals, the light that's emitted will be very specific
* The emitted light from an electron dropping back down to the energy level n=1 (Lyman series) will be too high energy and will not be visible
*  The opposite is true for an electron dropping back down to an energy of n=3 (Paschen series)
* Electrons dropping back down to energy level n=2 (Balmer series) will be visible
Fraunhofer Lines
* Since only certain electron excitations/emissions will be visible and statistically probable for each element, various lines for different elements are assigned letters and used for characterisation purposes

## Sodium D line

* A perfect example is the sodium D line
* Since the valence electron occupies the 3s orbital, the most common excitation and emission will the path from the $\ce{3p -> 3s}$
* This results in a  significantly brighter emission at 589 nm than any other wavelength.

## Hyperfine Spectrum

* When observed at very high resolution, spectral lines split can split into two (sodium $D_1$  and $D_2$)
* They are caused by an interaction of the atom's nuclear magnetic dipole moment, due to the distribution of charge within the atom.
* The distance of the orbitals can vary, so slightly that there is a marked difference in the energy absorbed and emitted.

## Absorption and Emission

* Since the excitation and emission processes happen in conjunction with each other, absorbance is proportional to the emission and an absorption spectra is ultimately an inverse emission spectra

## Fingerprinting

* Due to the specific nature of the electron configuration of each element, due to it's valence, electronegativity, mass, etc. Emission spectra can be used as a fingerprint of a different elements
