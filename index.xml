I really did. I used it for everyhting from remote python dev on supercomputers, to writing academic papers in LaTeX (see my old guide on getting it set up for proof). When VSCode came out with its &amp;ldquo;Remote Explorer&amp;rdquo; functionality I was torn. It was just too useful for the remote work I was doing, but it meant switching to a heavy electron app.
I missed the responsiveness of Sublime Text, but I found a new peace in the added functionality of the VSCode extention ecosystem.</description></item><item><title>Coding Stats</title><link>https://adreasnow.com/coding_stats/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2024 14:53:22 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://adreasnow.com/coding_stats/</guid><description>Stats These are my coding stats for the past 30 days and the past year as tracked by WakaTime.

This website is made in HUGO, it&amp;rsquo;s hosted on Github, and is deployed using Github Actions.
If you&amp;rsquo;d like to access my old site, it&amp;rsquo;ll still be up under adreasnow.com/acadmeic, so that I can keep adreasnow.com for my techy stuff instead &amp;#x1f642;</description></item></channel></rss>
