## To do

* [x] Read up on SAPT (For real this time... with note writing too, please)
  * [ ] Read deeper into SAPT
* [x] Write more Jupyter code?
* [x] process any Molclus jobs that have completed
* [x] OHS Induction module
* [x] Safety oficer induction
* [x] Hand in OHS forms to Sarah

## What I did



## Non-Covalent Interactions

### Electrostatic

Are interactions based on the overall charges on the molecules/atoms, positive and negative regions interacting

- As the charge difference increases , the electrostatic interaction increases, causing a stabilising effect
  - In SAPT, negative is more strongly interacting, positive is repulsive interaction

### Exchange

As electrons of degenerate orbitals with the same spin change places, there is a release of energy that stabilises the system

In multimolecular systems, this is more broadly reguarded as the “dance of electrons” that allows them to stabilise

Correlates to overalp, greater = higher exchange enrgy - destabilisng

### Induction

A diple on one of the molecules in the system can induce a dipole in the other molecule 



### Dispersion

Is from fluctuating dipoles between weakly interacting molecules, where the electron density itself (not a dipole) is enough to shift the electron density in another molecule to create a dipole.

Electron density in close proximity willl interact

### Charge Transfer

The electron density spill from one molecule to another
