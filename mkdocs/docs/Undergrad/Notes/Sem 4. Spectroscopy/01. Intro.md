# Introduction to Spectroscopy

## Definition

Spectroscopy - The study of matter and it's interaction with light, sound or particles (radiation)

* Can be through absorption, emission or scattering

## What is light?

* Light is EM radiation, consisting of an electric field and a perpendicular magnetic field
* Light travels at varying speed through a medium, being energy/wavelength dependent

## What is matter?

* A substance that has inertia and occupies physical space
* Made up of particles with different mass, charge and size

## Postulates of quantum mechanics

* Particles can only exist in discreet states, determined by their amount of energy
* Interactions of particles cause energy to be emitted or absorbed

$$
\Delta E=E_{excited}−E_{ground}
$$
			
* The frequency $\nu$ and wavelength $\lambda$ of the radiation is related to its energy

$$
\Delta E=h\nu=\frac{hc}{\lambda}
$$

## Energy states

* Energy states arise from molecular/atomic orbitals.
* The ground state is the lowest energy configuration of the compound 
* As energy is increased, the electrons can jump into a higher orbital with a discreet amount of energy, in what's called the excited state. 
* Rotational/vibrational states arise from energy in the bonds of the atom itself

## Waves

Consist of four properties:

* $\nu$ frequency
* $\lambda$ wavelength
* $A$ Amplitude
* $T$ Period

Expressed by the formula:

$$
y=A\sin\bigg(\frac{2\pi x}{\lambda} + 2\pi \nu t\bigg)
$$
		
## Energy equation

Where:

* $c=3\times10^8 m\cdot s^{−1}$
* $h=4.135\times 10^{−15} \text{ or	} 6.626×\times10^{−34} J$

$$
\Delta E=h\nu=\frac{hc}{\lambda}
$$

## Wavelength

$$
\lambda=\frac{c}{n\nu}\approxeq\frac{c}{\nu}
$$
						
## Wavenumber

$$
\bar{\nu}=\frac{1}{\lambda}
$$
