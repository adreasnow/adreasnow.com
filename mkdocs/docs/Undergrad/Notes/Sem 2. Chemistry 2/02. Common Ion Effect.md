# Common Ion Effect

When an ion involved in a $K_{sp}$ equilibrium equation reaction, is also found in the surrounding solution the solubility of the solid can vary.

E.g. Reaction dependent on pH

## Calculating

If you have an insoluble compound in a solution with a common ion, the concentration of the solution is involved in the ICE table

pH can also be converted into a concentration for these equilibria reactions

## Order of Precipitation

If there are multiple insoluble ionic compounds with the same common ion and differing $K_{sp}$  values they will precipitate at different concentrations of the common ion
