# Equations

<p markdown=True><h4>Rate law expressions. The sum ($x+y$) gives the overall order of the reaction.</h4></p>

$$
rate=k[A]^x[B]^y
$$

#### Relationship between concentration and time for a first-order reaction.

$$
\ln\frac{[A]_t}{[B]_0}=-kt
$$

<p markdown=True><h4>Equation for the graphical determination of $k$ for a first-order reaction.</h4></p>

$$
\ln[A]_t=-kt+\ln[A]_0
$$

#### Half-life for a first order reaction.

$$
t_\frac{1}{2}=\frac{0.693}{k}
$$

#### Relationship between concentration and time for a second-order reaction.

$$
\frac{1}{[A]_t}=-kt+\frac{1}{[A]_0}
$$
