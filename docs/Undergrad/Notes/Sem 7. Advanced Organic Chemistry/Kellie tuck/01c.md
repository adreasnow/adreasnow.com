### Solvent: Use DCM unless water is required

## Aldehydes → Carboxylic Acid (overoxidation/complet oxidation)

While most reagents in an aqueous solution will manage to completely oxidise an aldehyde due to their [equilibrium with their hydrated form](#primary-alcohols-aldehyde), possibly the most simple method is to use an aqueous solution of $\ce{Cr^{VI}}$ or an acidic/basic solution of $\ce{KMnO4}$.

## Secondary Alcohols → ketones

For secondary alcohols, pretty much all oxidising agents will work to convert them to a ketone.

### Jones Oxidation

Jones oxidation is often used for alcohols that aren't acid sensitive, as it's difficult to over oxidise

A good alternative if the alcohol is acid sensitive is to use PCC

## Primary Alcohols → Aldehyde

Primary alcohols can be oxidised to either an aldehyde (partial oxidation) or a carboxylic acid (complete oxidation).

In aqueous situations, the carboxylic acid will be in equilibrium with its hydrated form, which is readily oxidised to a carboxylic acid. ==This means that primary alcohols cannot be oxidised to aldehydes in an aqueous environment==

### Other Oxidising Agents

Some other oxidising agents to use could be Pyridinium chlorochromate PCC, pyridinium dichromate (PDC) or tetrapropylammonium perruthenate (TPAP)

#### Tetrapropylammonium Perruthenate (TPAP)

TPAP is a mild oxidising agent that can be regenerated in situ to use it catalytically

#### Dess-Martin Periodinane

Is another mild oxidising agent that has the ability to oxidise very sensitive alcohols to carbonyl compounds. Dess-Martin periodinane is made from IBX, which is a useful oxdising agent in itself, as it's insoluble in many organic solvents, ==meaning that it can be reacted slowly and filtered off, to control the level of oxidation==.

Dess-Martin periodinane is acetylated which makes it much more soluble in organic solvents and is in turn more reactive.

#### Swern Oxidation

Is another mild oxidising agent that will convert a primary alchol to an aldehyde. One of the products is $\ce{Me2S}$ which smells really bad, so the reaction needs to be carried out in a fume cupboard and all the glassware involved needs to be bleached ASAP.
