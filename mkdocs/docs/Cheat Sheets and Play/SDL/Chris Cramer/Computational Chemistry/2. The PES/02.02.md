## Basic assumptions/warnings

1. Depends on the BO approximation - isolates the energy purely to be dependent on the geometry of nuclei but not the electrons. 
2. A different PES exists for each electronic state of the molecule
3. The PES only corresponds to a single molecule.
4. by its definition it only shows potential energy… not kinetic energy
   * Total energy is conserved, so kinetic energy will increase as the potential energy decreases

## Features of the PES

You already know this to death..…

* The saddle point shows us the transition state **structure** not the transition state of the system 

## Transition Rate Constant

Equation for rate constant of transition structure, according to transition theory, where:

* $k =$ Rate constant
* $k_b =$ Boltzmann constant
* $T = $ Temperature (K)
* $\Delta E =$ $\Delta G$ (transition state - ground state) - $\Delta E$ refers to a single molecule
* $R =$ Gas constant

$$
k=\bigg(\frac{k_b T}{h}\bigg)e^{\frac{-\Delta E ^\ddagger}{RT}}
$$

!!! note
	The whole PES is not necessary for these thermochemical calculations..… How can we calculate only the stationary points?
