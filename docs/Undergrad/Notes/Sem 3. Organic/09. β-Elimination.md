Substitution reactions can go one of two ways, if the resulting nucleophile acts as a base AND if there's a neighbouring H (on the $\beta$ carbon), then elimination will occur, creating an alkene as one of the products.

When more than one $\beta$ H is available, the more substituted form will be the most stable and thus the likely major product.
