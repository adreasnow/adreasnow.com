## To do

* [ ] Read deeper into SAPT
* [ ] Check SAPT job completeness against SAPT processing notebook
* [ ] Check Ni opt jobs
* [ ] Read Reimer Paper *"The Mechanism of Covalent Bonding"* and figure out what Katya wants.
* [x] Manual PES of Pd with the various molecules
  * [x] Find optimal PES locations Genmer? Psi4 with genmer trajectory?
* [x] Compare HOMO energy in the SAPT processing sheet
  * [x] [Merge PD dataframes](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.07-merge-and-join.html#Specification-of-the-Merge-Key) or [By multiple keys](https://stackoverflow.com/a/32277531)

## What I did

I played around a lot with getting the PES scans to work. Gaussian was behaving exactly like it did with the opt, Psi4 wasn’t converging theSCF

I wrote some more code for Jupyter and SAPT analysis, including $\varDelta$homo and correlation heatmaps.

I kicked off the Li jobs as well as rerunning Ni molclus (since we’re doing lone Pd)
