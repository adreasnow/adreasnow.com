## To Do

* [ ] ~~Look into qcp~~
* [ ] Read up on SAPT
  * [ ] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou0dltm4zl4
* [ ] ~~Figure out why SSH boots me when I try to transfer files~~
* [x] Figure out how to automate genmer script
* [x] Write molclus slurm script
* [x] Psi4 run script

## Note!

Don't forget your first year chem!!

$$
\text{Formal charge}=\text{<valence electrons>}-\text{<lone pair electrons>}-\text{<bonds>}

In Boltzmann distributions, a $10\:kj\cdot mol^{-1}$ is a kind of cutoff of significance, sine it's going to have an incredibly small contribution to the expectation value. 



## What I did

Today I spent a lot of time scripting and wrote some beautiful tools to generate initial structures and optimise them using molclus/genmer, through gaussian. The recursive folder generations script worked a treat, and genmer is doing some really cool things in producing these structures.

I submitted all of the ions agains alkene but need to look into basis sets for the transition metals. I was suggested to look at ECP rather than all electron basis sets, but someone else just suggested using a dunning basis set from the basis set exchange.

It will likely take a while to get all my jobs through

I got an email from Simon that put me in the partner QOS pool, so I get that now... does mean that I had to resubmit though... again... only a little bit annoying :expressionless:

I found a [paper](../../../Papers/Internship%20Papers/#1-olejniczak-a-cichy-b-strek-w-dft-calculations-of-metal-organic-i-iii-vi-semiconductor-clusters-benchmark-of-exchange-correlation-functionals-and-localized-basis-sets-comput-mater-sci-2019-163-december-2018-186195-httpsdoiorg101016jcommatsci201903036) that suggests to stick with dunning basis sets for my transition metals, I guess it's just up to which ones to use, and whether to go full electron or ECP and for which metals



#### In the evening

OMFG so many issues... I think i've fixed them though?
A few things to remeber:

1. DO NOT USE PATH AS A VARIABLE WITHIN A SCRIPT

2. Just let the scripts run `bash -l` find a better way to check for an interactive shell... like:
```bash
if [ -n "$PS1" ]; then
exec -l zsh -l
fi
```
