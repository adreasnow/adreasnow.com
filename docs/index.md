!!! error "Burnout..."
    I decided to drop my PhD and have been working in the tech industry as a DevOps engineer since November 2023. <br/>
    The PhD stipend, working hours, and cost of living crisis all became too much for me to be able to justify continuing, so despite loving the work I was doing I've decided that finding the income to focus on my mental and physical health was more important than a sheet of papaer and rather fancy hat.<br/><br/>
    I'm going to keep this website up for as long as possible, through I may move it from [adreasnow.com](adreasnow.com) at some point to allow me to focus on my tech work instead :slightly_smiling_face:<br/>
    :heart: Adrea

I'm Adrea, a computational chemistry PhD candidate at Monash University. The purpose of this site is mainly to act as a repository of my notes and ramblings, it's  an incoherent collection of random markdown files, cobbled together with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) that I wanted to be easily accessible and searchable.

If you find value in it, that's always useful, but this is primarily a tool for myself and I don't expect it to be anything to anyone else, apart from collaborators or people that I want to share specifics with.

 Some of the things I'll be keeping in here are:

* Research notebooks
* Cheat sheets for specific applications, tools, processes or techniques
* Notes based on different resources that I’ve pursued.
* Some notes from undergrad (please don’t judge me too harshly for those...)
