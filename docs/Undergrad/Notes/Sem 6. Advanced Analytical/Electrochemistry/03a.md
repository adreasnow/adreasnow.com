# Electrical Storage

Cells can either be:

* Galvanic - they produce electricity from chemical reactions
* Electrolytic - they produce chemical reactions from electricity

In power storage, we consider the energy density, rather than energy alone, that is that we look at $\frac{Wh}{kg}$.

Energy $1Wh=3600\:J$

Power $1W=\frac{3600J\:}{60\min}=\frac{1\:J}{s}$

Electrical storage fits primarily into three categories:

## Batteries

Utilise a controlled chemical reaction with finite reactants to produce electricity. They can be primary - (non rechargeable) or secondary (rechargeable). They can be single or multi cell, with each cell having the following components:

### Anode

The negative electrode. This gives up electrons to the circuit as it is oxidised

### Cathode (think cation - positive)

The positive electrode. This accepts electrons from the circuit and is reduced

### Electrolyte

Provides the medium for the charge transfer, as ions in the battery that will migrate between the cathode and the anode

### Separator

Keeps the two electrolytes from binding and forming a non reactive salt

## Fuel Cells

Ae fundamentally similar to batteries, with the primary exception that they require a constant flow of the fuel, rather than having a self contained reserve.

## Supercapacitors

Store electricity as a potential between two charged surfaces. These are electrostatic storage mechanisms, not chemical and are designed for short, intense pulses of power, with charging in between, rather than a continuous current as would be provided by a typical battery.

The defining factor for a supercapacitor over a capacitor is that supercapacitors have very large, porous plates (large $A$) with very small dielectric mediums (small $L$), causing them to be able to build up a much larger charge compared to their regular counterparts.

In the application below, we can see that with a supercapacitor as opposed to a regular capacitor, in a system where a constant voltage is needed, when power pulses are required from the same power source, the voltage can be maintained to a much higher degree than with regular capacitors in their place.

## Fitting them all together

The ragone plot shows us how all of these technologies overlap in terms of their energy and power output.
