## To Do

* [ ] Read up on SAPT

  * [ ] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou0dltm4zl4

* [x] Write some smarter Jupyter code?

  * [ ] Perhaps a way to input a list and compare all the energies specified?
  * [x] Data stripping into jypyter?

* [x] HR compliance modules

  

## What I did

I mostly did two things today:

1. I checked the SAPT output of some completed jobs and tried to figure out for myself what means what
2. I wrote a decent amount of python code in Jupyter to be able to easily select and compare different systems

As point 1 might imply, the SAPT jobs have finally been running, and they're surprisingly fast (like 45 mins). As I right this at 6:45pm, though, massive has reached its disk quota and nobody is around to look in to it :confused:
