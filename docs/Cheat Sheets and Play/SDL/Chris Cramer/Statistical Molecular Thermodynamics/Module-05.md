# Internal Energy and Enthalpy

## The First Law

1. Energy is always conserved, it cannot be created or destroyed ($\Delta U=q+w$)

!!! info "Definitions"
	Energy can only be transferred through two mechanisms:
	
	* Work ($w$) - the transfer of energy as a result of unbalanced forces
	* Heat ($q$) - transfer of energy resulting from a temperature difference
	
	**Adiabatic processes** are those in which no heat, or mass is transferred between the system and its surroundings. Energy is only transferred through work

## State Functions

Are properties that depend only upon the state of the system, and not the path used to get there.

While *energy* is a state function, *work* and *heat* are not, these are called path functions

* State functions can be integrated in the form $\int_1^2dU=U_2-U_1=\Delta U$
* Path functions are integrated in the form $\int_1^2\delta w=w$ (not $\Delta w$ or $w_2-w_1$)

The sum of heat and work (inexact differentials) is an exact differential ($\Delta U$)

## At Constant Pressure

The equation can be rearranged to give $q_P=\Delta U+P_{ext}\int_{V_1}^{V_2}dV$

This means that $q_P$ becomes a state function, called the enthalpy:

$$
\begin{align}
q_P&=\Delta U+P\Delta V\\
&=\Delta H
\end{align}
$$

	At this point, the content came into the realm of stuff I'm already familiar with from [Chemistry 2](../Module-05a/), so I copied the notes into this section, but won't bother to add anything redundant.
