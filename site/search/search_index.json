Iron does not appear to play a significant role in the cyclization because 8a has been successfully cyclized to 10a using 1:1 v/v acetic acid:phosphoric acid [6] and concentrated hydrochloric acid (this study) without iron. In the first mechanistic scenario, strong acid would protonate the enone carbonyl in 8a to give 11, which would be activated toward conjugate addition by the amino group. Because the amine function in 8a is part of a vinylogous amide, it is not as basic as a typical aniline nitrogen, and thus, some of the unprotonated form should be present to add to the acti- vated enone system. Alternatively, strong acid condi- tions could also protonate the enone double bond to give the benzylic carbocation 12, which would then be attacked by the nucleophilic aniline nitrogen.\u201d</p> <p>Bunce, R.

This notion has been at the forefront of chemical research for as long as inductive and resonance effects have been utilised to manipulate the strength of bonds. While the understanding that electrons (as negatively charged particles) could be influenced by an Electric Field (EF) has been around for over a century, the idea of utilising these fields to influence reactivity has only been explored in the past 30 years.</p> <p>The methods to this approach were initially theoretical in nature and experimentally crude, involving the use of ionic clusters and concentrated salt solutions,<sup>1</sup> however, through the use of early ab initio techniques, the mechanisms by which \u2018electrostatic catalysis\u2019 could be achieved were able to be more rigorously and precisely investigated. These computational studies in the early 90s sought to understand solvent effects, and more generally the effects of localised EFs on chemical reactions, such as the Friedel-Crafts<sup>2</sup> reaction in which appropriately placed point charges were found to \u201cdramatically lower\u201d the reaction barrier. Further evidence for the direct influence of electrostatic catalysis came from biology, as the concept that within the binding site of an enzyme, an Internal Electric Field (IEF) generated by charged amino acids within the binding site could effectively be creating a pre-ordered environment that would stabilise the substrate\u2019s Transition State (TS).<sup>3</sup></p> <p>Through the development of the valence bond (VB) model of chemical reactivity, Sini et al.<sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> discovered that all covalent bonds could be stabilised through the introduction of charge-separated resonance contributors. A bond between atoms \\(\\ce{A}\\) and \\(\\ce{B}\\) could be described by the equation\\linebreak \\(\\ce{[A+ B- &lt;-&gt; A-B &lt;-&gt; A- B+]}\\), with the specific ratio combinations of these resonance contributors defining how ionic the resulting bond is. In Equation 1 this is described in VB notation, as the superposition (linear combination) of the contributing resonance species (\\(\\ce{A-B}\\), \\(\\ce{A- B+}\\) and \\(\\ce{A+ B-}\\)), with the amount that each resonance form contributes as a coefficient (\\(C_1\\), \\(C_2\\) and \\(C_3\\)). This gives rise to the most stable form of the bond, whose wavefunction (\\(\\Psi_{\\ce{A-B}}\\)) can be polarised by stabilising one of the ionic resonance species over another.</p> <p>This theoretical formalism laid the groundwork for further computational research into the field, with Shaik et al.<sup>6</sup> continuing to explore the effects of external electric fields (EEF). Initially, they created selectivity between competing nonpolar epoxidation and hydroxylation reactions<sup>6</sup> and later, Meir et al. identified that an Oriented EEF (OEEF) applied uniformly across all atoms could afford endo/exo selectivity of Diels-Alder reactions by polarising the TS and allowing for the mixing of new charge-transfer states. As shown in Figure 1.1, this was demonstrated through a model Diels-Alder reaction, where following the concerted cycloaddition, the reaction trajectory was found to be a linear combination of only the mixing of the reactant and product states, resulting in a single transition state. By introducing an electric field that stabilised the polarised Charge Transfer state (CT), a lower energy zwitterionic intermediate would form that reduced the overall barrier of the reaction.<sup>8</sup> Simply put, the resulting CT state had a much lower energy than the non-polarised TS reducing the barrier of the reaction.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 1.1: Valence bond diagrams of a generic Diels-Alder reaction demonstrating (a) the uncatalysed, concerted pathway and (b) the resulting stepwise pathway with reduced barrier as a product of the stabilisation of the charge-transfer state, by the electric field denoted in the centre box.

This was accomplished by tethering the dienophile and diene to the STM plate and tip, respectively in such in a way as to align the forming bonds with the STM field direction. The tip and plate were brought into proximity of each other and the difference in potential between the two formed an OEEF which passed through the reaction axis of the cyclisation. As shown in Figure 1.2, depending on the strength and direction in which the potential bias was applied, based on the VB diagrams in Figure 1.1 a different polarised TS would be stabilised. In the absence of the field and at low field strengths, the natural polarity of the molecule resulted in species I being the main resonance contributor to the superposition of the TS. The direction of the field could either stabilise or destabilise this resonance form changing the composition of the TS and thus the barrier height of the reaction. At stronger field strengths, species III was also able to be stabilised, and since both resonance contributors became accessible, both field directions were seen to be catalytic. While this research was incredibly valuable as an experimental proof of concept for the progression of the field, being the first practical example of exclusively electrostatic catalysis, the impracticality of having to tether the reactants to align with the field left it unsuitable for any kind of reaction on scale.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 1.2: Polarised (I and III) and non-polarised (II) transition states of the model Diels-Alder reaction, used in the STM OEEF catalysis experiments of Aragon\u00e8s et al.<sup>9</sup></p> <p>With sufficient experimental evidence and a theoretical understanding of the effect of OEEFs, Shaik et al. formalised the \u201cgoverning effects and rules for electric-field effects on chemical reacivity\u201d,<sup>10</sup> here on referenced as the \u201crules\u201d. They are as follows:</p> <p>Rule 1) An EEF that is oriented along a \u201cbond axis\u201d will polarise the bond, favouring one of the ionic species (Equation 1), eventually cleaving it heterolytically. As this polarisation occurs, the bond dipole increases, causing it to interact more strongly with the OEEF, stabilising the species in the process. </p> <p>Rule 2) Every reaction possesses a \u201creaction axis\u201d which follows the flow of electrons from reactant to product, through the TS. In the view of an organic chemist, this follows the flow of the \u201ccurly arrows\u201d.</p> <p>Rule 3) Applying an OEEF along the \u201creaction axis\u201d will stabilise the TS by increasing the bond ionicity (as per Rule 1), and symmetry of the HOMO-LUMO overlap of the transition state allowing, will encourage mixing of the charge-transfer states.</p> <p>Rule 4) A molecule that either possesses a dipole moment or that is polarisable, will experience a torque that will cause it to rotate to align with a sufficiently strong OEEF. This is explored further in Section 1.2.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 1.3: OEEF direction and the resulting effect on the reaction trajectory for the Diels-Alder cyclisation of an asymmetrical ethene derivative into cyclopentadiene. Reproduced from Wang et al.<sup>11</sup></p> <p>Beyond the four rules laid out by Shaik, electrostatic control of reactions can be extended, to create discrimination between the reaction pathways that form different isomers. Wang et al.<sup>11</sup> demonstrated this theoretically in an ab initio study by using OEEFs to control the product formation of a Diels-Alder cycloaddition of polar, asymmetric ethene derivatives with cyclopentadiene (see Figure 1.3). Wang showed that by orienting the OEEF perpendicular to the reaction axis, discrimination could be created between the endo and exo pathways, or the R and S pathways, depending on the chosen cardinal direction. In the case of enantioselectivity, this discrimination occurred due to the OEEF in the positive X direction destabilising the R transition state and stabilising the S transition state causing a \\(44.4\\:\\kjmol\\) difference at \\(F_X=+0.25\\:\\va\\) (\\(F_X\\) denoting the X component of the cartesian vector \\(\\vec F\\)* of the OEEF). When the OEEF was flipped to point in the negative X direction, the selectivity favoured the R pathway over the S pathway with the same magnitude of separation between the two.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 1.4: Resulting \\R and \\S reaction pathways of the asymmetric Diels-Alder reactions from Wang et al., as perturbed by an OEEF of \\(F_X=0.005\\:\\eh\\) (\\(\\sim0.26\\:\\va\\))</p> <p>This enantioselection was the result of the OEEF pushing the electron density from one end of the molecule, through the ethylene bond to the other, depending on the direction of \\(F_X\\). Since the ethene was asymmetric, the more electronegative end of the molecule was more receptive to the electron density than the other, leading to a discrimination between the direction of the polarisation of the ethylene bond and the resulting energy of the R and S transition states. This discrimination occurred to all species in the reaction trajectory equally and thus had no effect on the barrier heights of the reactions, as shown in Figure 1.4. Selection occurred through discrimination between the energy of the reactant pre-complexes which could easily break apart and re-form to produce the lowest energy species as per Boltzmann statistics.</p> <p>Formal rules for OEEF controlled enantioselection are highly dependent on the specifics of the reaction. Therefore general rules cannot be made to characterise their behaviour beyond the non-specific: Rule 5) \u2018Control over the isomeric products of a reaction will likely come as the result of an OEEF oriented perpendicular to the reaction axis, and will not typically be associated with a net catalytic benefit.\u2019</p>"},{"location":"Honours%20Thesis/1.%20Introduction/#12-extending-the-use-of-oeefs-to-solution","title":"1.2 Extending the use of OEEFs to solution","text":"<p>While the STM experiments of Aragon\u00e8s et al.<sup>9</sup> were conveniently able to fix the reactants in the correct orientation to ensure that the OEEF passed through the reaction axis, reactions typically occur in solution making the adoption of the required geometry in relation to an OEEF far more challenging. Following Rule 4, however, when allowed to rotate freely the reactant will align itself with the OEEF according to its dipole moment.<sup>10</sup><sup>12</sup> The amount of  stabilising energy that is obtained from the OEEF can be quantified through the relationship \\(\\Delta E=20.7\\vec F\\cdot\\vec\\mu\\:\\kjmol)\\), where \\(\\vec F\\) is the EF strength (in \\(\\va\\)) and \\(\\vec\\mu\\) is the dipole moment (in Debye).

Solvents with a large dielectric constant will better stabilise highly polarised species than those with small dielectric constants, making them more susceptible to the OEEF\u2019s perturbation. This separation of charges is accomplished by the solvent molecules rearranging themselves to align in a way to form an internal electric field that cancels out the field produced by the charged solute, minimising the energy of the system. This process is not specifically limited to the stabilising solute, however, and the solvent molecules will also produce an IEF that will oppose out an EEF.<sup>12</sup> As a result, a trade-off must be made to choose a solvent which will maximise stabilisation and solubility of the polarised species, while minimising screening of the OEEF.<sup>15</sup></p>"},{"location":"Honours%20Thesis/1.%20Introduction/#13-the-cyclisation-of-2-aminochalcone","title":"1.3 The cyclisation of 2\u2019-aminochalcone","text":"<p>The cyclisation of 2\u2019-aminochalcone (1) to form aza-flavanone (4) is a simple example of an intramolecular aza-Michael conjugate addition in which the nucleophilic lone pair electrons from the nitrogen attack the adjacent \\(\\alpha,\\beta\\)-unsaturated ketone at the electrophilic \\(\\ce{C_\\beta}\\), pushing the electrons up the conjugated system and onto the receptive ketone oxygen.

Through this process, the CPCM method breaks down the solvation free energy into the energy required to form the solvation cavity, the electrostatic stabilisation afforded by the charge screening process, and the energy associated with the change in dispersion within the bulk solvent.<sup>24</sup> While the conductor scaling approach is an effective method for modelling high dielectric solvents such as water, it is less effective for low dielectric solvents, such as n-hexane.<sup>25</sup></p> <p>An extension to the CPCM model is that of the Solvent Model based on Density (SMD), which takes the electrostatic term from CPCM and calculates a new cavity-dispersion solvent-structure (CDS) term based on the charge density of the solute to account for the rest of the solvation free energy. It calculates the CDS term as the sum of short-range interactions between the solute and the first solvation shell, and as such uses extra parameters for the bulk surface tension, hydrogen bonding acidity and basicity, aromaticity and halogenicity.<sup>25</sup> When the system being studied is similar to the training data set which was used to parameterise the SMD model (as is the case for common organic reactions in conventional solvents), it can be considered a significant improvement over CPCM.</p>"},{"location":"Honours%20Thesis/1.%20Introduction/#16-research-objectives","title":"1.6 Research objectives","text":"<p>Following the work of Shaik et al.,<sup>10</sup> this project aims to use computational chemistry to investigate the cyclisation of 2\u2019-aminochalcone to form aza-flavanone under the influence of OEEFs. The ultimate goal of this research is to both identify whether the reaction is suitable for studying under the effects of OEEFs, and to act as a \u201ctheoretical roadmap\u201d to make better educated decisions for future theoretical and experimental studies into the effects of OEEFs on this reaction. </p> <p>The cyclisation of 2\u2019-aminochalcone to form aza-flavanone was chosen as the subject of this study for a number of reasons. Firstly, the synthesis of the reactant is a simple process and can be performed using off-the-shelf reagents. Secondly, due to the change in conjugation that occurs from the 1 \\(\\to\\) 2 \\(\\to\\) 3, the kinetics of the reaction can be easily monitored using UV-Vis spectrometry, or NMR spectroscopy. Thirdly, since the reaction is unimolecular, there are fewer factors that can influence its kinetics. This particular point is quite important when considering that the rate of intermolecular reactions would also be influenced by OEEF-induced diffusion through the solvent, and that having multiple constituents within a reaction would make aligning them with the OEEF significantly more difficult. Finally (and most importantly), the reaction forms a new chiral centre without any pre-existing chirality present in the reagents, making stereoselection significantly more impressive as a feat.</p> <p>As a part of this theoretical roadmap, this research aims to:</p> <ul> <li>Understand the catalytic processes involved in performing the reaction and identify the most appropriate pathway for studying the reaction under the influence of an OEEF.</li> <li>Identify how the reaction can be controlled using OEEFs to produce both catalysis and enantioselection, to quantify these effects, and to understand their mechanistic processes.</li> <li>Investigate how this OEEF mediated reaction control could be influenced by the addition of localised electric fields, through charged functionality.</li> </ul> <ol> <li> <p>Pocker, Y.; Buchholz, R.

Errors for this method have been benchmarked to \\(0.077\\:\\AA\\) for geometry optimisations and \\(10.75\\:\\kjmol\\) for barrier heights.<sup>6</sup></p> <p>For accurate benchmarking of non-OEEF perturbed systems, \u03c9B97M-V<sup>8</sup> was chosen as it has been shown to generally be the best performing DFT functional for geometry optimisations and barrier heights<sup>6</sup><sup>9</sup> with RMSD errors of \\(0.014\\:\\AA\\) and \\(7.0\\:\\kjmol\\) respectively<sup>6</sup>. In this research it was paired with Ahlrichs\u2019 quadruple-\\(\\zeta\\), doubly polarised basis set (Def2-QZVPP)<sup>10</sup>, as this family of basis sets have been parameterised<sup>11</sup> to work effectively with the RI-J approximations<sup>12</sup> that allow for significant speedups in the calculation of the coulombic terms of the DFT functional. These approximations introduce minimal errors of \\(\\sim0.2\\:\\kjmol\\) with hybrid DFT methods while affording decreases in computational cost of more than 8 times, making this method attainable for the systems studied in this research. All thermodynamic calculations throughout this research were calculated using M06-2X/6-31+G* with CPCM solvation for OEEF perturbed systems and \u03c9B97M-V/Def2-QZVPP with SMD solvation for non-OEEF perturbed systems. For standard state conditions,  a temperature of \\(298.15\\:K\\) was used for all thermodynamic calculations (except where otherwise stated) and all subsequent calculations assume 1 M concentrations.</p> <p>For non-OEEF perturbed, high level energetic calculations where high level thermodynamic calculations were not required, \u03c9B97M-V was used in conjunction with Ahlrichs\u2019 triple-\\(\\zeta\\), singly polarised basis set with added diffuse functions (Def2-TZVPD)<sup>10</sup>, with a slightly smaller integration grid. These modifications came with an associated RMSD error of \\(0.018\\:\\AA\\) for geometry optimisations and \\(7.4\\:\\kjmol\\) for energetics, such as PES scans.<sup>6</sup></p> <p>Throughout this research, errors have mostly been mitigated due to the use of relative energies and energetic differences, rather than using absolute energies alone. The DFT functionals chosen have all been shown to be robust and are often used as benchmarking points of reference in themselves.<sup>13</sup></p> <p>For all calculations involving the use of OEEFs, a tradeoff had to be made between choosing an affordable level of theory that would best describe the perturbative effects of the OEEF and also accurately representing the barrier heights of the system. While it could be assumed that more robust methods, such as \u03c9B97M-V would accurately represent both, given that the field of electrostatic catalysis is relatively new, few benchmark studies have been performed to verify this. Those performed by Aragon\u00e8s et al.<sup>7</sup> and Gryn\u2019ova et al.<sup>14</sup> had to be assumed representative of the systems studied in this work, due to time and resource limitations.<sup>15</sup> As such, any and all kinetic and thermodynamic calculations performed on systems perturbed by OEEFs can only be considered to represent the change in rate as a result of the OEEF and should not be considered qualitative for absolute kinetics. This is made even more prevalent by the recognition that in the Eyring-Polanyi equation, the rate constant is proportional to the exponent of the free energy, so very small changes in the energy result in very large changes in the rate, with \\(5.7\\:\\kjmol\\) equating to an order of magnitude difference in rate constant at room temperature. Throughout this work, all rate constants have been reported specifically as \\(\\log(k)\\), for the sake of simplicity.</p> <p>A full breakdown of all the calculation details for all the jobs performed can be found in Appendix F.</p> <p>It should be noted that throughout this work, all OEEF directions will be presented using the Gaussian<sup>16</sup> notation, which has the vector pointing from negative to positive, which has become standard in the field of electrostatic catalysis. This is contrary to conventional physics notation which describes the vector pointing from positive to negative as has been used throughout this work for molecular dipoles. This has the effect that when aligned, the molecular dipole points in the same direction as the OEEF.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Zhao, Y.; Truhlar, D. G.

Two potential pathways were theorised (Scheme 2), the first being activated through protonation of the ketone (5) and the second through protonation of \\(\\ce{C_\\alpha}\\), producing \\(\\ce{C_\\beta+}\\) (6). These pathways will be identified as \u2018Br\u00f8nsted acid 1\u2019 and \u2018Br\u00f8nsted acid 2\u2019, respectively. The Lewis base pathway was also known to be highly effective,<sup>2</sup> however the specific mechanism did not appear to have been fully elucidated. For the \u2018Lewis base\u2019 pathway in this research, the nucleophile was assumed to attach to the carbonyl carbon, forcing the carbonyl \\(\\pi\\) electrons onto the oxygen, as shown in Scheme 3.</p> <p></p> <p>Scheme 2: Br\u00f8nsted acid catalysed pathways 1 (top) and 2 (bottom) of \\(\\bf{1}\\to\\bf{4}\\) as suggested by, and recreated from <sup>1</sup></p> <p></p> <p>Scheme 3: Theorised Lewis base pathway for the aza-Michael addition of 2\u2019-aminochalcone to form aza-flavanone</p> <p>It had been mentioned by Totildek\u00e9s et al. <sup>3</sup> that the reaction could also be catalysed using a \u201cstrong base,\u201d so a \u2018Br\u00f8nsted base\u2019 pathway was devised in which one of the labile amine protons was removed, giving the nitrogen a formal negative charge, as shown in Scheme 4.</p> <p></p> <p>Scheme 4: Theorised Br\u00f8nsted base pathway for the aza-Michael addition of 2\u2019-aminochalcone to form aza-flavanone</p> <p>For completeness, a \u2018Lewis acid\u2019 pathway was devised in which \\(\\ce{BF3}\\) was used as a Lewis acid (as shown in Scheme 5), similarly to the addition of a proton into the oxygen as per the Br\u00f8nsted acid 1 pathway.</p> <p></p> <p>Scheme 5: Theorised Lewis acid pathway for the aza-Michael addition of 2\u2019-aminochalcone to form aza-flavanone</p> <p>To assess the theoretical performance of each of the pathways, the S isomer of the reactant, intermediate and cyclisation product of each of pathway was initially built with Avogadro\\(^2\\) (1.94.0),<sup>4</sup> and was optimised at M06-2X/aug-cc-pVTZ in ORCA<sup>5</sup>, using CPCM<sup>7</sup><sup>6</sup> ethanol. This geometry was subsequently refined and thermodynamic calculations were performed at \\(298.15\\:K\\), using \u03c9B97M-V/Def2-QZVPP with SMD<sup>8</sup> ethanol for solvation.</p> <p>For finding the transition states, \u2018nudged elastic band\u2019 calculations were performed to find the TS geometry through interpolation between the reactant and intermediate, and intermediate and cyclisation product geometries, before being optimised to a saddle point in ORCA at M06-2X/aug-cc-pVTZ with CPCM ethanol. The optimised TS geometries were subsequently refined with \u03c9B97M-V/Def2-QZVPP in SMD ethanol, before being used to calculate thermodynamic energies as per the same method for the product, intermediate and reactant. Where barrierless reactions were suspected, the PES along the reaction coordinate was scanned using \u03c9B97M-V/Def2-TZVPD in ORCA to confirm the absence of a barrier. These scans were performed by holding the reaction coordinate distance at fixed values while optimising the rest of the structure around it. Increments of \\(0.05\\:\\AA\\) along the reaction coordinate were scanned, from their covalently bonded distance to a distance at which the bond would be completely dissociated. If the energetic pathway between bonded and dissociated had no intermediate maxima, the reaction was considered to be barrierless. These PES scan can be found in Appendix A</p> <p>Finding the transition state geometries of the Lewis base pathway proved significantly more difficult and required the use of Hessian guided optimisations, which involved performing thermodynamic calculations at \\(298.15\\:K\\) for each optimisation step and using the calculated force constants to guide to optimisation algorithm. These were performed in ORCA at \u03c9B97M-V/Def2-TZVPD in SMD ethanol. Thermodynamic calculations to obtain benchmarking results were performed in ORCA as per the other transition states.</p> <p>From the thermodynamic calculations benchmarking the energy of the six potential pathways, the energies were made relative to the non-activated reactant. For the Br\u00f8nsted acid pathways, this was accomplished by adding on the \\(\\Delta G^\\circ\\) of \\(\\ce{H3O+}\\) calculated at the same level of theory to the non-activated reactant, and adding on the \\(\\Delta G^\\circ\\) of \\(\\ce{H2O}\\) to all the states in the Br\u00f8nsted acid pathways. The corrected non-activated reactant \\(\\Delta G^\\circ\\) was then subtracted from the Br\u00f8nsted acid pathways to give the relative energy with respect to the non-activated pathway. This process was repeated with different corrective terms for each pathway, as shown in Table 3.1. The \\(\\Delta G^\\circ\\) for each of transition state 1 was not modified in any way, since they explicitly included all the components of the cyclisation pathways, and in the case of the Br\u00f8nsted pathways, explicitly used \\(\\ce{H2O}\\) and \\(\\ce{H3O+}\\) as proton acceptors and donors.</p> <p>Table 3.1: Energetic terms added to each benchmarked pathway to normalise them to the non-activated reactant.</p> Pathway Added to non-activated reactant Added to cyclisation pathway Br\u00f8nsted acid \u00bd \\(\\ce{H3O+}\\) \\(\\ce{H2O}\\) Br\u00f8nsted base \\(\\ce{H2O}\\) \\(\\ce{H3O+}\\) Lewis Acid \\(\\ce{BF3}\\) - Lewis Base \\(\\ce{piperidine-}\\)(\\(\\ce{(CH2)5N-}\\)) - <p>The choice to use water to balance out the protonation states was made, as without any electrons in the \\(\\ce{H+}\\) ion, it is impossible to calculate its energy using standard quantum mechanical methods, so the \\(\\ce{H2O + H+ &lt;=&gt; H3O+}\\) equilibrium was used in conjunction with Hess\u2019 law. The difference between the \\(\\ce{H2O}\\) and \\(\\ce{H3O+}\\) energies can be considered that of the \\(\\ce{H+}\\) ion, affording an easy way to obtain the proton energy through thermodynamic cycles. This is a commonly used approach where energetics of protonation are of significance, such as for the determination of \\(pK_a\\). While experimental values could be used to model just the \\(\\ce{H+}\\) energy, since explicitly modelled, participating \\(\\ce{H2O}\\) and \\(\\ce{H3O+}\\) were used for certain states in the reaction trajectory, this allowed for the cancellation of methodological errors. <sup>9</sup> The relative energies of each pathway were subsequently plotted in Figure 3.1.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 1.1:Relative reaction trajectories of the non-activated and five catalysed reaction pathways of \\(\\bf{1}\\to\\bf{4}\\). Where no transition states are present, that portion of the pathway was found to be barrierless.</p> <p>Barrier heights for each step of each potential pathway of \\(\\bf{1}\\to\\bf{4}\\) were calculated, and \\(\\log(k)\\) rate constants for each step were determined, using the approach described in Section 1.4. For all steps within the pathways that had distinct barriers, Equation  was used to calculate the rate constant, with the transmission coefficient from the Skodje-Truhlar approximations (Equation 5) being used to account for quantum tunnelling effects. Where no barrier was present, the rate constant was calculated using Equation 3 instead, and without a barrier, transmission coefficient calculations were not necessary. The rate constants for the formation of the intermediate and the cyclisation step were multiplied together to give the overall rate constant for that particular pathway. Any subsequent steps within the pathways would involve further workup experimentally, and were thus not considered to effect the rate of cyclisation. The non-activated pathway involved no intermediate formation, and thus only one step was considered.</p> <p>Table 3.2: Rate constants (\\(\\log(k)\\)) for both the intermediate formation reactions and the cyclisation, for each of the six pathways of \\(\\bf{1}\\to\\bf{4}\\).

Multiwfn<sup>10</sup> was used to calculate the CHELPG partial charges, based off the \u03c9B97M-V/Def2-QZVPP calculated wavefunction.

Skodje-Truhlar transmission coefficient calculations were performed based on these new values, and were used in the Eyring-Polanyi equation to obtain new rate constants, as shown in Figure 3.6. The imaginary frequency of the transition state was not recalculated, and as such, the transmission coefficient would likely overestimate the proportion of the rate due to tunnelling, however this would introduce minimal error, compared to the large increase in kinetic energy through the increase in temperature. </p> <p>Figure 3.2: Transition state 2 of each of the pathways, excluding the Br\u00f8nsted acid 2 pathway, as due to its barrierless nature, no transition state geometry exists.

PES scans were conducted of the cyclisation of the intermediate species, with the proton attached to the cyclising amine, and attached to the Lewis base, forming \\(\\ce{piperidine+}\\). As shown in Figure 3.3a, the cyclisation could only occur if the proton was attached to the Lewis base, as otherwise the new \\(\\ce{N-C}\\) bond was negligibly stable and would likely dissociate. In attempting to optimise the transition state with the deprotonated cyclising amine however, the piperidinium kept dissociating in order to neutralise its charge. Further PES scans were performed to investigate this dissociation and as can be seen in Figure 3.3b, once protonated, the piperidinium leaving was a barrierless process, indicating that it would dissociate before it could catalyse the cyclisation through this particular mechanism.</p> (a) (b) <p>Figure 3.3: a) PES scans along the forming bond of the Lewis base pathway, with the free proton on the Lewis base (blue) and on the cyclising amine (orange). b) PES scan of the \\(\\ce{N_{LB}-C}\\) bond distance of the protonated Lewis base leaving the carbonyl carbon, prior to cyclisation occurring. The scans in a) were performed with constrained \\(\\ce{N_{LB}-C}\\) bond distances, in order to prevent the dissociation of the species.</p> <p></p> <p>Scheme 6: Revised Lewis base pathway for the aza-Michael addition of 2\u2019-aminochalcone to form aza-flavanone</p> <p>Having identified that the negative charge was more stable on the cyclising amine, its deprotonation was subsequently assessed for the presence of a barrier with the Lewis base floating freely in the solution, and again, the barrier was not present, leading to the formation of the revised Lewis base mechanism depicted in Scheme 6. In this mechanism, the Lewis base acted as a coordinating Br\u00f8nsted base, stabilising the negative charge through hydrogen bonding, as shown in Figure 3.2e. Given that the rate determining step in the Br\u00f8nsted base pathway was the removal of the amine proton, for the piperidine to result in a barrierless deprotonation, and an intermediate that is more stable than the reactant, explains the efficiency of this pathway as observed by Zheng et al. <sup>2</sup>.</p> <p>Of all the pathways investigated, the fastest was the Br\u00f8nsted acid 2 pathway, which achieved catalysis through the formation of a carbocation in the \\(\\beta\\) position. These results did not agree with the partial charge analysis however, likely due to donation of electron density from the adjacent phenyl ring. Analysis of the LUMO of the intermediates of the non-activated and Br\u00f8nsted acid 2 pathways (Figure 3.4) revealed that the main driving force of was the formation of the new tetrahedral geometry of \\(\\ce{C_\\alpha}\\). As a result of this change in geometry, \\(\\ce{C_\\beta}\\) became far more exposed to the HOMO lone pair electrons on the nitrogen (not depicted in Figure 3.4), making orbital overlap significantly more likely than for the non-activated pathway. Comparing this to the transition state 2 geometries shown in Figure 3.2, the slight torsional strain to the \\(\\ce{C_\\alpha=C_\\beta}\\) bond that needed to happen for proper HOMO-LUMO overlap to occur, was not required in this pathway, making it less sterically unfavourable for the cyclisation to proceed, due to the breaking of the \\(\\ce{\\alpha,\\beta}\\)-unstaurated ketone.</p> (a) Non-activated (b) Br\u00f8nsted acid 2 <p>Figure 3.4: Isosurfaces of the LUMO from the non-activated and Br\u00f8nsted acid 2 pathway intermediate species, following an isovalue of 0.05.</p> <p>The other key driving factor was the instability of the \\(2^\\circ\\) carbocation. This particular species was more unstable than the charged species of any other pathway studied, due to the breaking of the \\(\\ce{\\alpha,\\beta}\\)-unstaurated ketone, which prevented the charge from being distributed up into the more electron rich atoms on the other side of the molecule. The result was that \\(\\ce{C_\\beta}\\) adjacent phenyl ring had an overall partial charge of +0.52, compared with the non-activated pathway, in which the ring had an overall charge of +0.13, indicating the redistribution of the formal charge predominantly throughout the right side of the molecule.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 3.5: Barrier height of the cyclisation step of each of the pathways plotted against their respective transition state bonding distance. A linear trendline (\\(R^2=0.996\\)) has been added to demonstrate the linearity of the non-intermolecularly stabilised species transition state bond length as a function of their barrier height. The Br\u00f8nsted acid 2 pathway has been omitted, as no transition state geometry exists.</p> <p>As can be seen in Figure 3.1, the other pathways all followed a relatively similar trend to each other. The Lewis base and Br\u00f8nsted base pathways both resulted in significantly more stabilised products than the Lewis acid and Br\u00f8nsted acid 1 pathways, as the basic pathways resulted in the deprotonation of the amine, leading to the products containing only a single \\(2^\\circ\\:\\alpha\\) carbocation, instead of the zwitterionic species of the acidic pathways. Compared with the non-activated pathway, all of the catalysed pathways, except for the Br\u00f8nsted base had transition states and products that were more stable, likely helping to not only increase the rate of the reaction, but also to reduce any re-crossing of the barrier. As can be seen in Figure 3.2 all of the catalytic pathways resulted in earlier transition states for the cyclisation step than in the non-activated pathway, which correlates quite well with their respective barrier heights, as shown in Figure 3.5. The Lewis base pathway was likely an outlier due to the intermolecular stabilisation contributed from the piperidine, which was not present in the other pathways, and has been depicted as such in Figure 3.5. This can also be seen as this pathway was closest mechanistically to the Br\u00f8nsted base pathway and has a similar TS bonding distance, however it possesses a lower overall barrier height. This correlation indicates that with the exception of Br\u00f8nsted acid 2, all the pathways ultimately follow the same approach to catalysing the reaction; increasing the electrophilicity of \\(\\ce{C_\\beta}\\) and/or increasing the nucelophilicity of the cyclising amine.</p> <p>Multiple approximations and assumptions had to be made to calculate the energy of these pathways. The largest of which was that while the use of SMD solvation does afford a certain amount of stability to separated charges, it lacks the ability to properly hydrogen bond and distribute the charge throughout the medium in the way that explicit solvation does. This particular issue may have caused \\(\\ce{H3O+}\\), \\({piperidine-}\\) and \\(\\ce{C_\\beta+}\\) species to not be stabilised to the same extent that they would have if solvated explicitly, resulting in the driving force for the barrierless reactions to be the mitigation of these charged species. If the systems were solvated with explicit water, it is likely that the extra solvent molecules would share their lone pair electrons and that the resulting complex would be significantly more stable than is being represented in the calculations above. This, in turn, may possibly have introduced barriers to these processes, particularly in the formation of the Br\u00f8nsted acid 1 pathway intermediate. While this could be accomplished by explicitly solvating at least part of the reactant with water or ethanol molecules, the nature of the catalytic pathways had been sufficiently studied to reach the aims of this research.</p> <p>Further discrepancies from experiment within this method came from the use of transmission coefficient approximations. Using the Skodje-Truhlar approximation, transmission coefficients were estimated to make a significant contribution to the rate constant of \\(\\kappa&gt;13.6\\) for proton transfers, compared with \\(&lt;1.3\\) for the cyclisation steps. Given that these approximations are known to overestimate the effects of quantum tunnelling, this will have associated errors that cannot be easily quantified due to the complexities of quantum phenomena. With how small the proton is, conventional approaches to quantum mechanics which decouple the movement of the protons and electrons, can no longer be assumed to be correct and as such, protons (particularly labile ones) should be treated similarly to an electron in quantum calculations; the proton should be modelled as a wave instead of a particle.<sup>11</sup></p> <p>While the errors for the chosen methodology can be considered relatively low for density functional theory,<sup>12</sup><sup>13</sup> it is important to note that errors in the range of \\(\\pm 8\\:\\kjmol\\) are not insignificant when calculating rate constants, which are highly sensitive to small fluctuations in energy. The errors are also calculated as RMSD values, based off benchmarking datasets that may not be representative of the systems being studied in this work.</p> <p>Generally speaking, \u201cchemical accuracy\u201d is considered to be \\(\\sim4.2\\:\\kjmol\\)</p> <p>Given how dependent these systems are on the dynamic behaviour of protons, to truly capture their behaviour an ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) approach that incorporates nuclear quantum effects would need to be implemented, such as utilising the Feynman path integral AIMD approach (PI-AIMD) to model the system, as demonstrated by Cassone, [^Cassone2020] however given the aims of this research, such approaches would be unjustifiably expensive.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 3.6: \\(\\log(k)\\) Rate constants of the non-activated pathway as a function of temperature.</p> <p>From this work, despite its relatively high reaction barrier and low rate constant, the non-activated pathway was identified as the optimal pathway to study further, under the influence of an OEEF for a number of reasons. Firstly; while its rate constant corresponds to a reaction half life of between 7 and 14 days (depending on the reaction order), under the influence of an OEEF it is very possible that this could be reduced significantly. Secondly; as previously stated, all thermodynamic calculations were performed at \\(298.15\\:K\\). Increasing the temperature would result in a significant increase in the reaction rate, as can be seen by the slope of the curve in Figure 3.6. Depending on the order of the reaction, a \\(25\\dc\\) temperature increase to \\(50\\dc\\) would result in a reaction half life of between 6 and 13 hours, which in conjunction with the effects of an OEEF would be be sufficiently fast for the purposes of experimental research.</p> <p>Given that the the reaction is unimolecular and that the reaction site is pre-organised within the molecule, it is likely that it would be on the lower end of this scale</p> <p>The choice to investigate the non-activated pathway further was also motivated by its simplicity, in that no extra reactants were required to make the cyclisation occur. In moving this reaction into the experimental space, in order to maximise the propagation of an OEEF through the solvent, tight control of ionic species in solution would be required to ensure that minimal charge screening occurs. Another potential issue could arise in that the the OEEF would induce charge based diffusion through the solution that may interfere with the approximations and assumption made in statistical mechanics based kinetic approaches, adding another variable that would need to be accounted for.</p> <p>Given that the cyclisation of 2\u2019-aminochalcone is not known to occur spontaneously, it is very probable that a proton source would be required to shuttle the ammonium proton up to the \\(\\alpha\\) carbocation to create a more stable product. Further investigation should be carried out to determine if water by itself would be sufficient for this purpose, or if small amounts of acid would be required to accomplish this experimentally, however as previously discussed, this investigation would likely require the use of explicit solvation and ab initio molecular dynamics approaches<sup>15</sup> and could not be justified for this particular investigation.</p>"},{"location":"Honours%20Thesis/3.results/#32-static-benchmarks-based-on-cardinal-field-directions-following-the-rules","title":"3.2 Static benchmarks based on cardinal field directions, following the \u201crules\u201d","text":""},{"location":"Honours%20Thesis/3.results/#321-benchmarking-the-non-activated-pathway-barrier-as-a-function-of-f_y","title":"3.2.1 Benchmarking the non-activated pathway barrier as a function of  \\(F_Y\\)","text":"<p>The \u03c9B97M-V/Def2-QZVPP optimised geometries of the product, transition state, and reactant of the non-activated pathway from Section 3.1 were oriented with their \\(\\ce{C=O}\\) bond along the Y axis, and their \\(\\ce{O=C-C_{\\alpha}}\\) angle in the X/Y plane, as per Figure 3.7.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 3.7:\u00a0Non-activated transition state of 2\u2019-aminochalcone, as aligned to the cardinal axes</p> <p>With this constraint in place, according to Rule 3, the field direction which would have the most stabilising effect on the transition state and thus the largest catalytic effect would be the field that follows the reaction trajectory.

Because of this, to reduce computational cost by taking advantage of stereoisomeric symmetry, further studies within this research were performed only on the S isomer. The assumption was made that any and all results pertaining to OEEF mediated stereoselectivity could be generalised to the R isomer by flipping the Z component of \\(\\vec F\\) across the X/Y plane.

For \\(\\ce{-NO2}\\), the effects appeared to be dependent on the location within the molecule, with \\(\\ce{R1=NO2}\\) leading to significant stabilisation of the S isomer and destabilisation of the R isomer, and \\(\\ce{R2=NO2}\\) leading to a systematic destabilisation of both isomers.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 3.22: Electronic energy of the R (red) and S (blue) energy of each derivative in their optimal field, relative to the non OEEF-perturbed derivative\u2019s energy.</p> <p>An important feature of note, was that the \\(\\ce{R1=NH2, R2=H}\\) and \\(\\ce{R1=NH2, R2=NH2}\\) systems stabilised the R isomer so much that it resulted in a reversal of which isomer was more stabilised, and so to account for this, the optimal OEEF direction was also flipped. This posed a new mechanism, by which the OEEF pushed electron density from the \\(\\ce{R1}\\) amine, onto the cyclising amine, to stabilise the S isomer. This also slightly destabilised the R isomer by pushing some of the ketone electron density onto \\(\\ce{C_\\beta}\\), making it less electrophilic.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 3.23: Electronic energy of the R (red) and S (blue) isomer of each derivative as perturbed by the \\(\\ce{R1=H, R2=H}\\) optimal field, relative to the non OEEF-perturbed derivative\u2019s energy.</p> <p>Through all of these derivatisations, it was possible that any stabilisation that occurred was simply from the increase in bulk of the molecule resulting in a larger anisotropic polarisability in the Z axis, so further calculations were performed, with all permutations of \\(\\ce{R1,R2=H, \\it{t}-Bu}\\). Since the tert-butyl groups contain large amounts of bulk without introducing any extra charge, any deviation from \\(\\ce{R1,R2=H}\\) could be considered due to polarisation-only effects. These calculations were carried out as per all other relaxed OEEF scans, in Psi4 at M06-2X/6-31+G*, however only the perturbation of the optimal field direction of \\(\\ce{R1,R2=H}\\) (as shown in Figure 3.21) was investigated. These results were plotted in Figure 3.24.</p> (a) (b) <p>Figure 3.24: a) Electronic energy of the R (red) and S (blue) isomers of all permutations of \\(\\ce{R1,R2=H, \\it{t}-Bu}\\), as perturbed by the optimal S selective OEEF for \\(\\ce{R1=H, R2=H}\\), a) relative to their non-perturbed energy. Differences between the energy of the t-Bu derivatised geometries and \\(\\ce{R1=H, R2=H}\\) have been plotted in b) to explicitly show the stability afforded by the added polarisability of the bulky groups alone.</p> <p>Looking at Figure 3.24, the effects of the additional polarisation that arise from having larger functionality can be considered minimal, with a maximum contribution from the addition of t-Bu groups to be \\(1.2\\:\\kjmol\\). For the most part, these effects were non-preferable, as the addition of polarisable groups always led to a more stabilised R  isomer, over S. In cases where the S isomer was destabilised, this was likely due to the t-Bu groups accepting the electron density that would otherwise be localised at the cyclising amine, and in cases where the R isomer was stabilised, this was likely due to the slight increase in electron density that was afforded to the \\(\\alpha\\)-\\(\\beta\\) unsaturated ketone.</p> <p>With polarisability providing minimal contribution to the effects of derivatisation on the stereoselectivity afforded by OEEFs, in order to isolate the influence of through-bond effects of the added functionality from their electrostatic influence, further calculations were performed using point charge perturbation methods, as described by  Gryn\u2019ova et al. <sup>23</sup>. These methods replace the R groups with specifically placed point charges, and thus any change to the energy of the system as a result of these perturbations can only be considered the result of electrostatic effects.</p> <p>Taking the M06-2X/6-31+G* optimised geometry of \\(\\ce{R1=H, R2=H}\\), using ORCA, charges of \\(q=+0.1\\) and \\(q=-0.1\\) were placed \\(3\\AA\\) from the \\(\\ce{R1}\\) and \\(\\ce{R2}\\) terminal hydrogen, in line with their \\(\\ce{C-H}\\) bond. All permutations of \\(\\ce{q1/q2=-0.1, 0, 0.1}\\)  were constructed and single point energy calculations were performed on both the R and S isomers of each of these geometries, as perturbed by the \\(\\ce{R1=H, R2=H}\\) optimal OEEF direction. Their energy was calculated relative to their non OEEF-perturbed counterparts and were plotted in Figure 3.25.</p> <p>The specific charge strengths were chosen somewhat arbitrarily, however can be considered representative of the overall point charges of the functionality chosen. It could be argued that the magnitude of a nitro group would be significantly more negative and that an amine would be significantly more positive, however much like the rest of this section, these calculations were considered a qualitative investigation into the trends, rather than a quantification of the effects.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 3.25: Potential energy of the R (red) and S (blue) isomer of the non derivatised 2\u2019-aminochalcone, with \\(q_1/q_2=0.1, 0\\), or \\(0.1\\) point charges in place of the R groups.</p> <p>As can be seen in Figure 3.25, the trends of the system could be identified by looking at the two positions independently. Charges in the \\(\\ce{q1}\\) position resulted in the separation of the two species, with \\(q_1=+0.1\\) resulting in the inverse separation of the species, stabilising the R isomer and destabilising the S isomer, and \\(q_1=-0.1\\) resulting in a large destabilisation of the R isomer with a modest stabilisation of the S isomer. In the \\(\\ce{q2}\\) position, the charges had a more subtle, systematic effect, influencing both isomers equally, with \\(q_2=+0.1\\) destabilising both and \\(q_2=-0.1\\) stabilising both.</p> <p>This was likely the result of the charges in \\(\\ce{q2}\\) changing the angle of the molecular dipole subtly, either pushing or pulling the electron density across the molecule.  Through its extensively conjugated system, this changed the charge ratio between the cyclising amine and \\(\\ce{C_\\beta}\\). As with functionality in the \\(\\ce{R1}\\) position, the contribution of the charges in the \\(\\ce{q1}\\) position mostly effected the cyclising amine, either pushing electron density onto the amine, or pulling it away, causing it to be more or less reactive (respectively).</p> <p>Both of these findings were in line with the the results of Figure 3.23, with the \\(q_1=+0.1\\) behaving similarly to the \\(\\ce{-NH2}\\) group and the \\(q_1=-0.1\\) behaving similarly to the \\(\\ce{NO2}\\) group. Using Figure 3.23 as a baseline, this point charge study could be considered an energy decompositon method, and thus given the negligible influence of the increased polarisability shown in Figure 3.24, any stabilisation effects not seen inFigure 3.25 could be considered to come specifically from through bond effects. Given how well the point charges alone replicate these results, it can be concluded that the effects of the R groups were predominantly electrostatic in nature.</p>"},{"location":"Honours%20Thesis/3.results/#36-thermodynamic-benchmarking-of-the-derivatised-and-non-derivatised-species","title":"3.6 Thermodynamic benchmarking of the derivatised and non-derivatised species","text":"<p>To truly understand the effects of derivatisation, the reactant, transition state and product of \\(\\ce{R1,R2=H}\\), \\(\\ce{R1,R2=NO2}\\) and \\(\\ce{R1,R2=NH2}\\) were calculated, with thermal corrections to obtain Gibbs free energies and rate constants.

To maintain consistent results, the optimised directions of \\(\\vec F\\) at a magnitude of \\(0.1\\:\\va\\) from Section 3.3 were used, ignoring those identified in Secion 3.5. For completeness, and to ascertain how a stronger OEEF would effect the rate constants, the process was repeated at a field strength of \\(|\\vec F|=0.2\\:\\va\\).

This was predominantly due to two specific processes; firstly, the process of optimising the geometry in Secion 3.5 occurred in the gas phase, reducing the amount of screening that would realistically exist between the remote functionality and the reaction site. This resulted in geometries in which the transition state bonding distances were much larger, placing the charged functionality closer to the Z axis, which as discussed in Section 3.3 had an increased effect on the stereoselectivity of the reaction.</p> (a) Non-derivatised (b) \\(\\ce{R1,R2=NO2}\\) \u00a9 \\(\\ce{R1,R2=NH2}\\) <p>Figure 3.26: \\(\\log(k)\\) rate constant differences between the catalytic and stereoselective OEEFs for the non-derivatised and \\(\\ce{R1,R2=NO2}\\) derivatised species of 2\u2019-aminochalcone in \\(|\\vec F|=0\\), \\(0.1\\) and\u00a0\\(0.2\\:\\va\\)</p> <p>Secondly and probably more significantly, Secion 3.5 only looked at the trends of differences in the transition state stability, as previous findings within this research had shown that the reactant was particularly unperturbed by the OEEF. This turned out not to be the case when derivatised, with the nitro groups making the reactant more polarisable than the product. The same effect was noticed for \\(\\ce{R1,R2=NH2}\\) however to a much smaller extent. This polarisability shift also influenced the effects of the OEEF away from the expected catalytic and stereoselective behaviours, with the nitro groups ultimately increasing \\(\\Delta G^{\\circ\\ddagger}\\) for the S isomer and the amine groups decreasing it.</p> <p>In general however, due to the resonance effects of the 5\u2019 amine (\\(\\ce{R1=NH2}\\)) contributing electron density to 2\u2019 amine, all of the \\(\\ce{R1,R2=NH2}\\) perturbations resulted in larger rate constants and faster reaction times, which when coupled with the non-negligible stereoselective rate differences could be considered a positive if trying to make the reaction occur within a more reasonable timeframe. The inverse happened for the 5\u2019 nitro group (\\(\\ce{R1=NO2}\\)), with the electron withdrawing properties deactivating the 2\u2019 amine, resulting in a significant decrease to the rate constants of the species.</p> <p>While the stereoselective effects of the \\(\\ce{R1,R2=NO2}\\) species were significantly lacking, the catalytic effects were impressive, though this was largely a product of how slow the non OEEF-perturbed reaction itself was. In reality, this catalysis did not occur as a result of the the stabilisation of the transition state, so much as a destabilisation of the reactant. This was can be clearly identified, as contrary to conventional logic, the increasing OEEF strength ultimately resulted in a less stable transition state.</p> <p>One particularly significant issue of note was that due to Rule 4, if \\(\\vec F\\) was not aligned with \\(\\vec\\mu\\), with the restraints put in place on the position and angle of the ketone, the molecule would start to contort itself to align its dipole with the OEEF (full figures of this can be seen in Appendix C As the magnitude of the OEEF increased, this contorting increased, both causing significant internal strain within the molecule, and moving the reaction axis out of alignment with the OEEF. From this alone it can be seen that for an OEEF that is not aligned to a molecule\u2019s dipole to be able to have a positive effect, it either needs to be toggled fast enough to not allow the geometry to relax and align itself, or the magnitude of the OEEF needs to be tuned in such a way for the rotational torque afforded by the processes in Rule 4 to be mitigated by the structure of the solvent itself.</p> \\[ \\begin{align} ee&amp;=\\frac{k_{\\text{favoured}}-k_{\\text{disfavoured}}}{k_{\\text{favoured}}+k_{\\text{disfavoured}}}\\label{eqn:ee-from-k}\\tag{11} \\end{align} \\] <p>With the recognition that both the non-derivatised and amine derivatised (\\(\\ce{R1,R2=NH2}\\)) species of 2\u2019-aminochalcone could be considered viable options for further study, enantiomeric excesses (ee) were subsequently calculated from the relative R and S isomer rate constants, using Equation 11<sup>24</sup>.

Derivatisation was able to influence the rate and stereoselection afforded by the OEEF, however the specific intricacies of each system need to be investigated individually, as few generalisations could be made from this particular study.</p> <p>Catalysis of the formation of racemic aza-flavanone was also found to be achievable with an OEEF directed along the reaction axis from the newly forming \\(\\ce{N-C}\\) bond up to the ketone, with in increase in \\(\\log(k)\\) rate constant of 2.4 at \\(|\\vec F| = 0.1\\:\\va\\) and 3.2 at \\(|\\vec F| = 0.2\\:\\va\\).</p> <p>This research focused on the use of optimal OEEF directions to obtain maximum stereoselective and catalytic results, however these effects were observed in non-optimal OEEF directions as well. Any deviation in OEEF direction from parallel with the reaction axis, in line with the newly forming \\(\\ce{N-C}\\) bond caused a quantifiable amount of stereoselection.</p> <p>It was found that the magnitude of the OEEF had to be kept relatively low for stereoselection to occur, as the rotational torque experienced by the molecule as \\(\\vec\\mu\\) would try to align with \\(\\vec F\\), prevented the molecule from remaining in a stereoselective orientation. This is an important consideration when taking this research experimentally into the realm of freely rotating molecules in solution, as maintaining their orientation will likely come down to balancing the rotational torque with stabilising intermolecular interactions. </p> <p>While this research was limited in what it could accomplish owing to time constraints, and resource limitations, it has provided valuable insights into the behaviour of the reaction, allowing for research to move forward with a more solid understanding of its behaviour within an OEEF.</p> <p>Research by Xu et al. <sup>1</sup> has demonstrated that one way to overcome many off the limitations of conventional solvents within an electric field is to use EEFs to align a solvent composed of ionic liquids (IL), allowing them to generate an IEF that can act upon the solvated reaction. In doing so, this would overcome issues pertaining to competing electrochemical reactions, and would reduce the likelihood of an electronic double layer forming at the electrodes that would drastically attenuate the OEEF. Work by the Pas and Coote groups has shown that IEFs of \\(&gt;0.2\\:\\va\\) can be formed and maintained for extended periods of time within an IL by aligning them with an OEEF before removing the field,<sup>2</sup> and there is further evidence to show that ILs exhibit extensive hydrogen bonding within solution<sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup> that could be utilised to align a solute in a particular orientation relative to the generated IEF. This hydrogen bonding could potentially provide enough rotational stabilisation to the overcome the rotational torque of the OEEF, allowing for stereoselection to occur.</p> <p>In conjunction with research carried out by other members of the Pas group, the next steps for this research are to explore the reaction using polarisable molecular dynamics and ab initio molecular dynamics approaches to understand how different ILs will influence stereoselectivity, and to better understand the role of the generated IEF in translating this theoretical work into a more viable experimental protocol.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Xu, L.; Izgorodina, E.

You have always had confidence in my abilities, even when I\u2019ve not been able to find the confidence in myself, and I\u2019m sure that you will continue to do so as I tackle a PhD. Your support since I emailed you as an undergraduate at another university has motivated me to keep pursuing better things in academia and your support on a personal level and constant empathy for what I\u2019ve endured this year has prevented me from giving up entirely.</p> <p>Secondly, Michelle Coote who through listening to my tired and incoherent ramblings has opened up new avenues of investigation in my work and picked apart some of my less logical thought processes. You have kept my brain in check and ensured that I don\u2019t become complacent in my work.</p> <p>To the staff and facilities of the Monash eResearch centre and MASSIVE, who\u2019s support and resources facilitated this research at the most fundamental level. Without computational resources, computational chemistry doesn\u2019t happen, and despite a plethora of technical issues, you\u2019ve pulled through, have been been there when I\u2019ve needed, and have always responded promptly to any and all service tickets I\u2019ve had to lodge.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>All the members of the Pas group, who have endured my constant excited posting on Slack, and who have helped me with otherwise illogical issues. It sucks that we\u2019ve not been able to share an office this past year but hopefully soon we\u2019ll be popping out for a cheeky coffee together. In particular to Peter, Michael and Tom who have helped me with all sorts of technical and theoretical queries and issues that I\u2019ve had over the course of the year. Some of your contributions to my project won\u2019t have made it into this work, but will definitely help, going forward.</p> <p></p> <p>To everyone who has helped to provide feedback on my thesis; Katya, Michelle, Peter, Sophie, Michael and India. You helped me to consolidate my mindless ramblings into a cohesive, polished thesis that\u2019s deserving of submission. Thank you.</p> <p>And finally, to all the members of my personal support network, both academic and non-academic, Michael, Erica, Alex, Rhys, India and Steph, without who I doubt I\u2019d have had the had the emotional energy to make it through it through the year, and deal with the setbacks of research.</p>"},{"location":"Honours%20Thesis/9.appendix/","title":"Appendices","text":"<p>Working iPython notebook files for the processing of data relating to benchmarks and all raw data for the OEEF scanning sections can be found at   GitHub.

For EFP parameters calculations, 6-311++G(3df,2p) basis set is recommended. Original Stone\u2019s distributed multipole analysis (bigexp=0 in the group $stone is recommended for non-aromatic compound; optionally, one may decrease the basis set to 6-31G* or 6-31+G* for generation of electrostatic multipoles and screening parameters. (To prepare such a \u201cmixed\u201d potential, one has to run two separate MAKEFP calculations in larger and smaller bases, and combine the corresponding parts of the potential). In aromatic compounds, one must either use numerical grid for generation of multipoles (bigexp=4.0) or use 6-31G* basis with standard analytic DMA, which is recommended.

A possible way to deal with this delicate issue is the use of learn-on-the-fly or machine-learning classical Hamiltonians.505,506 In this context, one can envisage a classical potential fully consistent with the QM\u2212MM Hamiltonian that should be used for its construction along the time scale of the simulation. An example is the technique developed by Cs\u00e1 nyi and co-workers,506,507 in which the force field parameters are recomputed every few steps along a classical dynamics simulation to achieve full consistency with the DFT forces inside a selected \u201cQM cluster\u201d.

However, this does not mean that the 0-0 excitation energy is not experimentally measurable. The point is that, when one approximates the ground and excited state potential energy surfaces as quadratic surfaces with the same quadrature, one can show that the 0-0 energy is exactly the average of the Franck-Condon absorption energy and the Franck-Condon fluorescence energy. Therefore, one can derive an experimental estimate of the 0-0 energy from an average of the experimental absorption and fluorescence energies. Some similar but slightly different alternatives are (1) averaging the absorption and fluorescence wavelengths instead (which is not equivalent to averaging the excitation energies due to the non-linear relationship between wavelengths and excitation energies), and (2) plotting both the absorption and fluorescence spectra, find the intersection point of the two spectra, and read off the corresponding excitation energy. I\u2019m not sure which of the three strategies is the best, but mathematically they should give quite similar results for systems whose Stokes shift is not too large; when the Stokes shift is very large, all methods should become unreliable since the quadratic approximation of the PESs break down (EDIT: this holds for most, if not all, realistic molecular PESs, but does not necessarily hold for artificial PESs, such as those that are by construction globally quadratic.

In all the spectra Laura took yesterday, there were a lot of lower energy peaks that mirrored that of the primary transition, or existed as an individual gaussian. In reading, these can be attributed to three distinct scattering phenomena:</p> <ol> <li>Rayleigh scattering (\\(\\lambda=\\lambda_{excitation}\\)) - This is simply scattering that happens at the same wavelength as the excitation source, and can be easily accounted for by making sure there\u2019s a 10nm gap between excitation and emission recording. This appears as a single gaussian.</li> <li>Raman scattering (Stokes) (\\(\\lambda&gt;\\lambda_{excitation}\\)) - This appears as a single gaussian and should be accounted for in the 10nm gap for Rayleigh scattering. </li> <li>Raman scattering (Stokes) (\\(\\lambda&lt;\\lambda_{excitation}\\)) - This also appears as a single gaussian but is much more difficult, since the scattered light may overlap with the fluorescence spectrum. One way to account for this is the obtain a spectrum of JUST the solvent and subtract this from the fluorescence spectrum.</li> <li>Second (and third) order diffractions - These appear as a copy of a part of the spectrum at a lower energy region, and include bot the fluorescence spectrum, and the three kinds of scattered light. This can mostly be accounted for by using emission filters to block out light that comes in from a greater angle to the diffraction grating. Setting the emission filter on the Cary Eclipse from \u201cOpen\u201d to \u201cAuto\u201d seems to do the trick.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"PhD/Notebook/0013-March-2023/#saturday-18th-march","title":"Saturday 18<sup>th</sup> March","text":""},{"location":"PhD/Notebook/0013-March-2023/#thought","title":"Thought:","text":"<p>Running ESD for every job to identify transitions seems a tad extreme, but what if we use gs/es hessians to figure out a vibrational state-specific transition energy.</p> <p>For this approach, we\u2019d need:</p> <ul> <li>GS hessian</li> <li>nEq ES@R(GS) hessian</li> </ul> <p>From these we should be able to figure out the excitation 0-0 transition (this will be different from the Eq/Eq 0-0 for Goerigk and Grimme) and the corresponding energies for each of the subsequent higher vibrational transitions.</p> <p>We\u2019re making heavy assumptions that the process will be adiabatic here though, and that the harmonic oscillator approach will hold.</p> <p>To verify the harmonic oscillator, I\u2019m running some anharmonic vibrational corrections using NWChem\u2019s VSCF module.
