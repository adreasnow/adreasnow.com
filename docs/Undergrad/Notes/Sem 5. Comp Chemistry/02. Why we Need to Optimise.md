# Why we need to optimise

* The most stable energy structure of the molecule is the minimum energy structure of the molecule
  * The nature of matter is that it will always do whatever is energetically favourable  to end up in the lowest energy state
* Structure ALWAYS dictates properties
* Isomer determination can be carried out by looking at a molecule's relative energies

### Structure obtained

* The geometry R at the global minimum energy $V - (V(R))$ is the optimised geometry
* The local minima is another stable isomer

### QM Model
* Are always written as theory/basis
  * The theory being the methodology/calculation set used to obtain the results
  * The basis set being the functions chosen to describe $\psi$ of $e^−$


* In property calculations, we use two sets of methodologies to describe the model

**<center>theory/basis // theory/basis</center>**

* Where the first set of methodology refers to the property calculation itself and the second refers to the optimisation methodology
  * This is because we'll usually run property calculations in conditions that we won't have originally optimised for
* Model1 is usually bigger than model2, because the optimisation is typically the heaviest computational process. 

* It's important to decide on your model before you start any calculations, as the logic you use  to decide this is really theoretically based
* Considerations involve:
  * What is my computer capable of
  * What properties do I need to obtain
  * How big is the molecule
  * Do I need to account for (each can vary in complication or importance of the issue as well):
    * Time dependence
    * Correlation
    * Core $e^−$
    * Charge
    * Polarisability
    * Solvation

* Models and basis sets are usually paired to obtain specific results, with different combinations being better for different things
  * Basis sets themselves vary in both accuracy and ease of calculation, with some basis sets being  far more accurate, but being harder to compute as a result, regardless of function count
	
* The specific theory used can also be a huge factor in the accuracy of any calculation
