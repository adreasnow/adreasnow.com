# The Relationship Between Reactant Concentration and Time

## Derivation of the integrated rate law (First Order)

For a first order reaction ($A\ce{->}\text{product}$), the $\text{rate}=-\frac{\Delta[A]}{\Delta t}$.

From the rate law, we know that $\text{rate}=k[A]$ with units $s^{-1}$, so combining the two equations, we get:

$$
-\frac{\Delta[A]}{\Delta t}=k[A]$
$$

When we integrate this, we get:

$$
\ln\frac{[A]_t}{[A]_0}=-kt
$$

Which can be rearranged to:

$$
\ln[A]_t=-kt+\ln[A]_0
$$

Which has the form $y=mx+b$. This conveniently means that if  we plot the natural log of the concentration over time of the equation, the gradient of the line $=-k$

## The Equations
$$
\ln\frac{[A]_t}{[A]_0}=-kt
$$

$$
\ln[A]_t=-kt+\ln[A]_0
$$
## Usage

This equation can be used to link concentrations and time of first order equations

!!! info "Example 1 - Conversion of cyclopropane $\ce{->}$ propene"
	
	The conversion of cyclopropane to propene in the gas phase is a first-order reaction with a rate constant of $6.7\times10^{-4}\:s^{-1}$ at 500°C.
	
	1. If the initial concentration of cyclopropane was 0.25 M, what is the concentration after 8.8 min? 
	
	$$
	\begin{align}
	\ln[A]_t&=-kt+\ln[A]_0\\
	[A]_t&=exp(-kt+\ln[A]_0)\\
	[A]_t&=exp\big[-(6.7\times10^{-4})(8.8\times60)+\ln(0.25)\big]\\
	[A]_t&=0.18\:M\\
	\end{align}
	$$
	
	2. How long (in minutes) will it take for the concentration of cyclopropane to decrease from 0.25 M to 0.15 M? 
	
	$$
	\begin{align}
	\ln\frac{[A]_t}{[A]_0}&=-kt\\
	\frac{\ln\frac{[A]_t}{[A]_0}}{-k}&=t\\
	\frac{\ln\frac{0.15}{0.25}}{-(6.7\times10^{-4})}&=t\\
	(762\:s)\times\frac{1\:min}{60\:s}&=t\\
	13\:min&=t
	\end{align}
	$$
	
	3. How long (in minutes) will it take to convert 74 percent of the starting material?
	
	$$
	\begin{align}
	\ln\frac{0.26}{1}&=-kt\\
	\frac{\ln\frac{0.26}{1}}{-k}&=t\\
	\frac{\ln\frac{0.26}{1}}{-(6.7\times10^{-4})}&=t\\
	2011\:s\times\frac{1\:min}{60\:s}&=t\\
	34\:min&=t\\
	\end{align}
	$$

## Reaction Half Life

Another metric that  we can use is reaction half life, that is the amount of time it takes for half the reactant to be consumed in the reaction. 

$$
t_\frac{1}{2}=\frac{0.693}{k}
$$

??? info "Derivation"
	
	$$
	\begin{align}
	\ln\frac{[A]_t}{[A]_0}&=-kt\\
	t&=\frac{1}{k}\ln\frac{[A]_t}{[A]_0}\\
	\text{By definition, the}&\text{ half life is when }[A]_t=[A]_0/2\text{, so}\\
	t_\frac{1}{2}&=\frac{1}{k}\ln\frac{[A]_0}{[A]_0/2}\\
	t_\frac{1}{2}&=\frac{1}{k}\ln 2=\frac{0.693}{k}\\
	\end{align}
	$$

We can see that the half life is independent of the starting concentration,

## Derivation of the integrated rate law (Second Order)

The second order rate law process holds firm for the first order, however we get a different integrated rate law. The multi-reactant integrated rate law is beyond the scope of Chang, but the single reactant, second order integrated rate law comes out as:

$$
\frac{1}{[A]_t}=kt\frac{1}{[A]_0}
$$

This still takes the form of a linear equation, however now the gradient $=+k$

The resulting half life equation also differs and we get:

$$
t_\frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{k[A]0}
$$

We now have an inverse correlation with the initial concentration.

Derivation of the integrated rate law (Second Order)

## Derivation of the integrated rate law (Zeroth Order)

We repeat the process once more and unsurprisingly, the resulting integrated rate law is:

$$
[A]_t=-kt+[A]_0
$$

There is a straight correlation between the concentration at $t_i$ and $t_f$, determined only by $k$
