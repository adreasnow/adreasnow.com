To Do:

* [ ] Read up on SAPT
  * [ ] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou0dltm4zl4
* [ ] Figure out how to extract HOMO-LUMO data of just one fragment
* [ ] ~~Figure out how to optimise Ethyne-Pd without it ripping itself apart.~~ (it's just it's nature)
* [x] Download Wine 5.0Rc5
  * [x] https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/macosx/pool/portable-winehq-devel-5.0-rc5-osx64.tar.gz
* [ ] Read paper for group meeting from Peter



## What I Did

I compiled openbabel for massive, set up some SAPT scripts, started running some ethene jobs and looked over the palladium and nickel output files.

I also started the Pd-Ethyne HF job, so that we can see if there is any interaction at a not-self destructing distance

## What I Learned

While we still couldn't get the palladium jobs to optimise nicely, we did find out some useful stuff, namely:

#### Palladium

Works end-on (attacking one of the ethyne hydrogen) by lowering the LUMO energy, donating into the anti-bonding orbitals.

#### Nickel 

Seems to lower the HOMO energy, side on (next to the triple bond) stabilising the transition structure by mixing with the $\pi$ orbitals.

Simply put, they have vastly different mechanisms of action, despite belonging to the same group
