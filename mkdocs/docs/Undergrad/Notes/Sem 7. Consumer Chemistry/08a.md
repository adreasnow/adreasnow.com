# Carbohydrates

As with other lectures in this unit, these notes are going to continue on from [Food Science - Carbohydrates](../../Sem%206.%20Food%20Science/05a/)

Carbohydrates can be defined by a few criteria:

* Hydrates of carbon, with the empirical formula $\ce{C_{n}(H2O)_{n}}$
* polyhydroxyaldehydes or polyhydroxyketones or substances that yield such compounds on hydrolysis



Uses include :

* ==A reservoir of chemical energy ($15.8\:KJ/g$ of energy)==
  * ==Proteins have slightly less energy per gram and fats have twice as much==
* Essential component of RNA and DNA
* Are constituents of supportive structures
  * In plants as cellulose
  * In crustacea and insects as chitin
* Are constituents of connective tissue in animals
  * Acidic polsaccarides such as hyaluronic acid

Plants are the primary producers of carbohydrates, accounting for 75% of the dry weight of the plant, and as such, animals get their supply by eating plants, however they don't store much of what they consume. Less than 1% of the body weight of a human is carbohydrate. Animals either consume carbohydrates and utilise them quickly or store them as fat.

## Some Common Monosaccharides

### D-Glucose (Dextrose or 'blood sugar') D-glucopyranose

* Found in fruits, vegetables, honey and corn syrups
* This is the building block of disacchardies ans polysaccharides

### Fructose (Levulose or 'fruit sugar') D-fructofuranose

* Sweetest carbohydrate (2x sucrose)
* Found in fruit juices and honey
* Is converted to glucose in the bloodstream
* Forms sucrose with glucose

### Galactose (galactopyranose)

* Does not occur as a monosaccharide in nature
* Obtained from the hydrolysis of lactose
* Important in the cellular membranes of the brain and nervous system

## Properties of 'Simple Carbohydrates' (monosaccharides)

* They are the sweetest of the sugars and can serve as an indicator of energy-rich foods
* Water soluble, due to their high oxygen content
* Crystallise when evaporated from solution
* The are an energy supply
* The can be fermented by micro-organisms (converted into simple alcohols)
* They are hypertonic and can serve as a preservative at high concentrations
* They caramelise upon heating

## Some Common Disaccharides

### Sucrose ('table sugar')

* Obtained from the evaporation of sugar cane juice (20% by mass) or sugar beets (15% by mass)
* Both raw and refined sugars are sucrose

### Lactose

* Found in milk and milk products
* Human milk contains 6-8% and cows milk contains 4-5%
* It's added to baby formula to mimic mother's milk

### Maltose ('malt sugar')

* Obtained from starch
* Used in cereals, candies and the brewing of beverages

## Carbohydrates and human health

Most of this you already know, but the glycemia tolerances are as follows:

* Hypo < 40 mg/mL
* Normal 70-60 mg/mL
* Hyper >140 mg/mL

### Galactosemia 

* Is a condition in which the enzyme that converts galactose to glucose is impaired causing galactose to accumulate in the body
* can cause mental retardation, cataract formation and liver damage
* Infants with the condition have to be given a lactose free diet.

## Polysaccharides

Are primarily a storage form for glucose in plants. Thy are stored by plant cells in granules and are easily hydrolysed in water and acid. In the human body, starch is digested by α-amylases in salava.

### Starch

Starch is made up of amylose and amylopectin, are not readily soluble in cold water, are not sweet and require cooking to improve digestibility and palatability 

#### Amylose

* Consists of continuous unbranded chains of ~4000 glucose units
* The units are joined together by α-1,4-glycosidic linkages
* Most starches are made of 20-25% amylose
* Forms a helical coil due to the bond rotation

#### Amylopectin

* Consists of branched chains of ~10000 glucose unit
* They are joined together by α-1,4-glycosidic linkages
  * They have considerable branching, at every 24-26 glucose units with new chains of 24-30 units that are joined by α-1,6-glycosidic linkages
* Most starches contain 75-80% amylopectin 

#### Gelatinisation

When the starch granules are heated in water, the granules take up the water and swell. This increases the viscosity of the liquid and forms a gel upon cooling. When these are frozen or aged, they can convert back into the starch granules

#### Dextrinisation

When the starches are dry-toasted or roasted, the outer layers will partially decompose to form dextrins. the aldehyde and ketone groups react to form new flavour compounds and give the product more complexity.

### Glycogen ('animal starch')

* Has the same branched structure as amylopectin (α-1,4-glycosidic bonds with α-1,6-branches), but is much more branched than amylopectin.
* It's stored in the liver (3-6%) and in muscles (1-2%)
  * Small amounts may be stored in the kidneys, glial cells (brain) and white blood cells
  * During pregnancy, some will be stored in the uterus
* Acts as an energy reserve of carbohydrates for animals
* In an adult, there will only be a total of ~350g of glycogen
* After slaughter, the glycgen is converted into lactic acid which improves the meat's tenderness

### Cellulose

* Is the major structural material of wood and plants
* Like amylose, it consists of long, unbranded chains of glucose units
* The glucose units are joined with β-1,4-glycosidic bonds
  * Humans lack the β-amylase that's required to break these bonds
* These strands don't form cils like amylose, but instead form long sheets that are very strongly hydrogen bonded together (to neighbouring subunits and neighbouring strands)
  * This makes them water insoluble and rigid
  * Makes them difficult to hydrolyse

## Acidic Polysaccharides

These contain carboxylic acid groups and sulfuric ester groups ($\ce{OSO3}$) and are found only in animals and bacteria. The contain amino sugars and are therefore called **glycosaminoglycans**. They play an important role in the structure an function of connective tissue and bind with collagen (protein) to form tight, or loose networks

### Hyaluronic Acis

* Simplest acidic polysaccharide
* Abundant in embryonic tissues, synovial fluid and vitreous of the eye
* Commonly used in lotions, moisturisers and cosmetics, due to their connective tissue boosting properties

### Heparin

* Heterogeneous mixture of variably sulfonated polysaccharides
* synthesised and stored in mast cells of various tissues, particularly in the liver, lungs and gut
* Plays an important role in many biological activities
* Is a prominent anticoagulant so it is commonly used in medicine.
