To Do:

* [ ] Read up on SAPT
  * [ ] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou0dltm4zl4
* [ ] Figure out how to extract HOMO-LUMO data of just one fragment
  * [ ] Perhaps another type of bond analysis?
* [x] ~~Read paper for group meeting from Peter~~ (I tried :( )
* [ ] Check output from ethene molclus calcs
* [ ] Check SAPT output from Ethyne-NTF2
* [ ] Check HF NBO calcs
* [ ] Check NTF2 molclus calcs
  * [ ]  Then get ethene HF calcs on 
* [x] Check Ethyne-PD HF calc

SAPT crashed again, this time because it couldn't access the scratch directory, so I fixed up the scripts and resubmitted

The Ethyne-PD job showed no interaction at the distance computed

[^1]:Ethyne-Pd can't be optimised to a minimum without it's tearing the ethyne apart and attempts to obtain useful information from a single point calculation on an assumed geometry present results that cannot be trusted.
