## To do

* [ ] Read deeper into SAPT
* [x] Check benzene-Ni - push it through
* [x] Work on presentation

## What I did

Pushed benzene-Ni through!!! Theyâ€™re all complete!!

I got most of the presentation done, I just need to finish of the last couple of slides and it should be good enough for tomorrow.

I got some fancy graphics out using pymol and gaussian cubes :smiley:
